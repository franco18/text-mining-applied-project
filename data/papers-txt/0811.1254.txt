This chapter introduces and elaborates on the fruitful interplay of coding theory
and algebraic combinatorics, with most of the focus on the interaction of codes
with combinatorial designs, finite geometries, simple groups, sphere packings,
kissing numbers, lattices, and association schemes. In particular, special interest
is devoted to the relationship between codes and combinatorial designs. We
describe and recapitulate important results in the development of the state of the
art. In addition, we give illustrative examples and constructions, and highlight
recent advances. Finally, we provide a collection of significant open problems and
challenges concerning future research.

1.1. Introduction
The classical publications “A mathematical theory of communication” by
C. E. Shannon [1] and “Error detecting and error correcting codes” by R. W. Hamming [2] gave birth to the twin disciplines of information theory and coding theory.
Since their inceptions the interactions of information and coding theory with many
mathematical branches have continually deepened. This is in particular true for the
close connection between coding theory and algebraic combinatorics.
This chapter introduces and elaborates on this fruitful interplay of coding theory and algebraic combinatorics, with most of the focus on the interaction of codes
with combinatorial designs, finite geometries, simple groups, sphere packings, kissing numbers, lattices, and association schemes. In particular, special interest is
devoted to the relationship between codes and combinatorial designs. Since we
do not assume the reader is familiar with the theory of combinatorial designs, an
accessible and reasonably self-contained exposition is provided. Subsequently, we
describe and recapitulate important results in the development of the state of the
art, provide illustrative examples and constructions, and highlight recent advances.
Furthermore, we give a collection of significant open problems and challenges concerning future research.

The chapter is organized as follows. In Sec. 1.2, we give a brief account of
basic notions of algebraic coding theory. Section 1.3 consists of the main part of
the chapter: After an introduction to finite projective planes and combinatorial
designs, a subsection on basic connections between codes and combinatorial designs
follows. The next subsection is on perfect codes and designs, and addresses further
related concepts. Subsection 1.3.4 deals with the classical Assmus-Mattson Theorem
and various analogues. A subsection on codes and finite geometries follows the
discussion on the non-existence of a projective plane of order 10. In Subsection 1.3.6,
interrelations between the Golay codes, the Mathieu-Witt designs, and the Mathieu
groups are studied. Subsection 1.3.7 deals with the Golay codes and the Leech
lattice, as well as recent milestones concerning kissing numbers and sphere packings.
The last topic of this section considers codes and association schemes. The chapter
concludes with sections on directions for further research as well as conclusions and
exercises.
1.2. Background
For our further purposes, we give a short account of basic notions of algebraic coding
theory. For additional information on the subject of algebraic coding theory, the
reader is referred to [3–13]. For some historical notes on its origins, see [14] and [6,
Chap. 1], as well as [15] for a historical survey on coding theory and information
theory.
We denote by Fn the set of all n-tuples from a q-symbol alphabet. If q is a
prime power, we take the finite field F = Fq with q elements, and interpret Fn as
an n-dimensional vector space Fnq over Fq . The elements of Fn are called vectors
(or words) and will be denoted by bold symbols.
The (Hamming) distance between two codewords x, y ∈ Fn is defined by the
number of coordinate positions in which they differ, i.e.
d(x, y) := |{i | 1 ≤ i ≤ n, xi 6= yi }| .
The weight w(x) of a codeword x is defined by
w(x) := d(x, 0),
whenever 0 is an element of F.
A subset C ⊆ Fn is called a (q-ary) code of length n (binary if q = 2, ternary if
q = 3). The elements of C are called codewords. A linear code (or [n, k] code) over
the field Fq is a k-dimensional linear subspace C of the vector space Fnq . We note
that large parts of coding theory are concerned with linear codes. In particular,
as many combinatorial configurations can be described by their incidence matrices,
coding theorists have started in the early 1960’s to consider as codes the vector
spaces spanned by the rows of the respective incidence matrices over some given
field.

The minimum distance d of a code C is defined as
d := min {d(x, y) | x, y ∈ C, x 6= y}.
Clearly, the minimum distance of a linear code is equal to its minimum weight , i.e.
the minimum of the weights of all non-zero codewords. An [n, k, d] code is an [n, k]
code with minimum distance d.
The minimum distance of a (not necessarily linear) code C determines the errorcorrecting capability of C: If d = 2e + 1, then C is called an e-error-correcting code.
Defining by
Se (x) := {y ∈ Fn | d(x, y) ≤ e}
the sphere (or ball ) of radius e around a codeword x of C, this implies that the
spheres of radius e around distinct codewords are disjoint.
Counting the number of codewords in a sphere of radius e yields to the subsequent sphere packing (or Hamming) Bound .

Then

If equality holds, then C is called a perfect code. Equivalently, C is perfect if
the spheres of radius e around all codewords cover the whole space Fn . Certainly,
perfect codes are combinatorially interesting objects, however, they are extremely
rare.
We will call two codes (permutation) equivalent if one is obtained from the other
by applying a fixed permutation to the coordinate positions for all codewords. A
generator matrix G for an [n, k] code C is a (k × n)-matrix for which the rows are
a basis of C. We say that G is in standard form if G = (Ik , P ), where Ik is the
(k × k) identity matrix.
For an [n, k] code C, let

C ⊥ := {x ∈ Fnq | ∀y∈C [hx, yi = 0]}
denote the dual code of C, where hx, yi is the standard inner (or dot) product in
Fnq . The code C ⊥ is an [n, n − k] code. If H is a generator matrix for C ⊥ , then
clearly
C = {x ∈ Fnq | xH T = 0},
and H is called a parity check matrix for the code C. If G = (Ik , P ) is a generator
matrix of C, then H = (−P T , In−k ) is a parity check matrix of C. A code C is
called self-dual if C = C ⊥ . If C ⊂ C ⊥ , then C is called self-orthogonal .

C := {(c1 , . . . , cn , cn+1 ) | (c1 , . . . , cn ) ∈ C,

defines the extended code corresponding to C. The symbol cn+1 is called the overall
parity check symbol . Conversely, C is the punctured (or shortened ) code of C.
The weight distribution of a linear code C of length n is the sequence {Ai }ni=0 ,
where Ai denotes the number of codewords in C of weight i. The polynomial
A(x) :=

n
X

Ai xi

i=0

is the weight enumerator of C.
The weight enumerators of a liner code and its dual code are related, as shown
by the following theorem, which is one of the most important results in the theory
of error-correcting codes.
Theorem 1.2. (MacWilliams [16]). Let C be an [n, k] code over Fq with weight
enumerator A(x) and let A⊥ (x) be the weight enumerator of the dual code C ⊥ .
Then

1−x
A⊥ (x) = q −k (1 + (q − 1)x)n A

1 + (q − 1)x
We note that the concept of the weight enumerator can be generalized to nonlinear codes (so-called distance enumerator, cf. [17, 18] and Subsection 1.3.8).
An [n, k] code C over Fq is called cyclic if
∀(c0 ,c1 ,...,cn−1 )∈C [(cn−1 , c0 , . . . , cn−2 ) ∈ C],
i.e. any cyclic shift of a codeword is again a codeword. We adopt the usual convention for cyclic codes that n and q are coprime. Using the isomorphism
(a0 , a1 , . . . , an−1 ) ⇄ a0 + a1 x + . . . + an−1 xn−1
between Fnq and the residue class ring Fq [x]/(xn − 1), it follows that a cyclic code
corresponds to an ideal in Fq [x]/(xn − 1).
1.3. Thoughts for Practitioners
In the following, we introduce and elaborate on the fruitful interplay of coding
theory and algebraic combinatorics, with most of the focus on the interaction of
codes with combinatorial designs, finite geometries, simple groups, sphere packings,
kissing numbers, lattices, and association schemes. In particular, special interest is
devoted to the relationship between codes and combinatorial designs. We give an
accessible and reasonably self-contained exposition in the first subsection as we do
not assume the reader is familiar with the theory of combinatorial designs. In what

follows, we describe and recapitulate important results in the development of the
state of the art. In addition, we give illustrative examples and constructions, and
highlight recent achievements.
1.3.1. Introduction to finite projective planes and combinatorial designs
Combinatorial design theory is a subject of considerable interest in discrete mathematics. We give in this subsection an introduction to the topic, with emphasis on
the construction of some important designs. For a more general treatment of combinatorial designs, the reader is referred to [19–24]. In particular, [19, 21] provide
encyclopedias on key results.
Besides coding theory, there are many interesting connections of design theory
to other fields. We mention in our context especially its links to finite geometries [25], incidence geometry [26], group theory [27–30], graph theory [4, 31], cryptography [32–34], as well as classification algorithms [35]. In addition to that, we
recommend [22, 36–39] for the reader interested in the broad area of combinatorics
in general.
We start by introducing several notions.
Definition 1.1. A projective plane of order n is a pair of points and lines such
that the following properties hold:
(i) any two distinct points are on a unique line,
(ii) any two distinct lines intersect in a unique point,
(iii) there exists a quadrangle, i.e. four points no three of which are on a common
line,
(iv) there are n + 1 points on each line, n + 1 lines through each point and the total
number of points, respectively lines, is n2 + n + 1.
It follows easily from (i), (ii), and (iii) that the number of points on a line is a
constant. When setting this constant equal to n + 1, then (iv) is a consequence of
(i) and (iii).
Combinatorial designs can be regarded as generalizations of projective planes:
Definition 1.2. For positive integers t ≤ k ≤ v and λ, we define a t-design, or
more precisely a t-(v, k, λ) design, to be a pair D = (X, B), where X is a finite set
of points, and B a set of k-element subsets of X called blocks, with the property
that any t points are contained in precisely λ blocks.
We will denote points by lower-case and blocks by upper-case Latin letters. Via
convention, we set v := |X| and b := |B|. Throughout this chapter, ‘repeated blocks’
are not allowed, that is, the same k-element subset of points may not occur twice
as a block. If t < k < v holds, then we speak of a non-trivial t-design.

Designs may be represented algebraically in terms of incidence matrices: Let
D = (X, B) be a t-design, and let the points be labeled {x1 , . . . , xv } and the blocks
be labeled {B1 , . . . , Bb }. Then, the (b × v)-matrix A = (aij ) (1 ≤ i ≤ b, 1 ≤ j ≤ v)
defined by

1, if xj ∈ Bi
aij :=
0, otherwise
is called an incidence matrix of D. Clearly, A depends on the respective labeling,
however, it is unique up to column and row permutation.
If D1 = (X1 , B1 ) and D2 = (X2 , B2 ) are two t-designs, then a bijective map
:
α X1 −→ X2 is called an isomorphism of D1 onto D2 , if
B ∈ B1 ⇐⇒ α(B) ∈ B2 .
In this case, the designs D1 and D2 are isomorphic. An isomorphism of a design D
onto itself is called an automorphism of D. Evidently, the set of all automorphisms
of a design D form a group under composition, the full automorphism group of D.
Any subgroup of it will be called an automorphism group of D.

If D = (X, B) is a t-(v, k, λ) design with t ≥ 2, and x ∈ X arbitrary,
then the derived design with respect to x is Dx = (Xx , Bx ), where Xx = X\{x},
Bx = {B\{x} | x ∈ B ∈ B}. In this case, D is also called an extension of Dx . Obviously, Dx is a (t − 1)-(v − 1, k − 1, λ) design. The complementary design D is
obtained by replacing each block of D by its complement.
For historical reasons, a t-(v, k, λ) design with λ = 1 is called a Steiner t-design.
Sometimes this is also known as a Steiner system if the parameter t is clearly given
from the context.
The special case of a Steiner design with parameters t = 2 and k = 3 is called
a Steiner triple system of order v (briefly ST S(v)). The question regarding their
existence was posed in the classical “Combinatorische Aufgabe” (1853) of the nineteenth century geometer Jakob Steiner [40]:
“Welche Zahl, N , von Elementen hat die Eigenschaft, dass sich die Elemente
so zu dreien ordnen lassen, dass je zwei in einer, aber nur in einer Verbindung
vorkommen?”

However, there had been earlier work on these particular designs going back to,
in particular, J. Plücker, W. S. B. Woolhouse, and most notably T. P. Kirkman.
For an account on the early history of designs, see [21, Chap. I.2] and [41].
A Steiner design with parameters t = 3 and k = 4 is called a Steiner quadruple
system of order v (briefly SQS(v)).
If a 2-design has equally many points and blocks, i.e. v = b, then we speak of
a square design (as its incidence matrix is square). By tradition, square designs
are often called symmetric designs, although here the term does not imply any
symmetry of the design. For more on these interesting designs, see, e.g., [42].

We give some illustrative examples of finite projective planes and combinatorial
designs. We assume that q is always a prime power.
Example 1.1. Let us choose as point set
X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
and as block set
B = {{1, 2, 4}, {2, 3, 5}, {3, 4, 6}, {4, 5, 7}, {1, 5, 6}, {2, 6, 7}, {1, 3, 7}}.
This gives a 2-(7, 3, 1) design, the well-known Fano plane, the smallest design arising
from a projective geometry, which is unique up to isomorphism. We give the usual
representation of this projective plane of order 2 by the following diagram:

Example 1.2. We take as point set
X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
and as block set
B = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}, {1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 8}, {3, 6, 9},
{1, 5, 9}, {2, 6, 7}, {3, 4, 8}, {1, 6, 8}, {2, 4, 9}, {3, 5, 7}}.
This gives a 2-(9, 3, 1) design, the smallest non-trivial design arising from an affine
geometry, which is again unique up to isomorphism. This affine plane of order 3
can be constructed from the array

as shown in Figure 1.2.

More generally, we obtain:
Example 1.3. We choose as point set X the set of 1-dimensional subspaces of
a vector space V = V (d, q) of dimension d ≥ 3 over Fq . As block set B we take
the set of 2-dimensional subspaces of V . Then there are v = (q d − 1)/(q − 1)
points and each block B ∈ B contains k = q + 1 points. Since obviously any
two 1-dimensional subspaces span a single 2-dimensional subspace, any two distinct
points are contained in a unique block. Thus, the projective space P G(d − 1, q)
d
−1
is an example of a 2-( qq−1
, q + 1, 1) design. For d = 3, the particular designs are
projective planes of order q, which are square designs. More generally, for any fixed
i with 1 ≤ i ≤ d − 2, the points and i-dimensional subspaces of P G(d − 1, q) (i.e.
the (i + 1)-dimensional subspaces of V ) yield a 2-design.
Example 1.4. We take as point set X the set of elements of a vector space
V = V (d, q) of dimension d ≥ 2 over Fq . As block set B we choose the set of affine
lines of V (i.e. the translates of 1-dimensional subspaces of V ). Then there are
v = q d points and each block B ∈ B contains k = q points. As clearly any two
distinct points lie on exactly one line, they are contained in a unique block. Hence,
we obtain the affine space AG(d, q) as an example of a 2-(q d , q, 1) design. When
d = 2, these designs are affine planes of order q. More generally, for any fixed i with
1 ≤ i ≤ d − 1, the points and i-dimensional subspaces of AG(d, q) form a 2-design.
Remark 1.1. It is well-established that both affine and projective planes of order
n exist whenever n is a prime power. The conjecture that no such planes exist
with orders other than prime powers is unresolved so far. The classical result of
R. H. Bruck and H. J. Ryser [43] still remains the only general statement: If n ≡ 1
or 2 (mod 4) and n is not equal to the sum of two squares of integers, then n does
not occur as the order of a finite projective plane. The smallest integer that is not a
prime power and not covered by the Bruck-Ryser Theorem is 10. Using substantial

Coding theory and algebraic combinatorics

computer analysis, C. W. H. Lam, L. Thiel, and S. Swiercz [44] proved the nonexistence of a projective plane of order 10 (cf. Remark 1.10). The next smallest
number to consider is 12, for which neither a positive nor a negative answer has
been proved.
Needless to mention that — apart from the existence problem — the question on
the number of different isomorphism types (when existent) is fundamental. There
are, for example, precisely four non-isomorphic projective planes of order 9. For a
further discussion, in particular of the rich history of affine and projective planes,
we refer, e.g., to [25, 45–49].
Example 1.5. We take as points the vertices of a 3-dimensional cube. As illustrated
in Figure 1.3, we can choose three types of blocks:
(i) a face (six of these),
(ii) two opposite edges (six of these),
(iii) an inscribed regular tetrahedron (two of these).
This gives a 3-(8, 4, 1) design, which is unique up to isomorphism.

Fig. 1.3.

Steiner quadruple system of order 8

We have more generally:
Example 1.6. In AG(d, q) any three distinct points define a plane unless they are
collinear (that is, lie on the same line). If the underlying field is F2 , then the lines
contain only two points and hence any three points cannot be collinear. Therefore,
the points and planes of the affine space AG(d, 2) form a 3-(2d , 4, 1) design. More
generally, for any fixed i with 2 ≤ i ≤ d − 1, the points and i-dimensional subspaces
of AG(d, 2) form a 3-design.
Example 1.7. The unique 2-(9, 3, 1) design whose points and blocks are the points
and lines of the affine plane AG(2, 3) can be extended precisely three times to the
following designs which are also unique up to isomorphism: the 3-(10, 4, 1) design
which is the Möbius plane of order 3 with P Γ L(2, 9) as full automorphism group,
and the two Mathieu-Witt designs 4-(11, 5, 1) and 5-(12, 6, 1) with the sporadic
Mathieu groups M11 and M12 as point 4-transitive and point 5-transitive full automorphism groups, respectively.

10

Michael Huber

To construct the ‘large’ Mathieu-Witt designs one starts with the
2-(21, 5, 1) design whose points and blocks are the points and lines of the projective plane P G(2, 4). This can be extended also exactly three times to the following unique designs: the Mathieu-Witt design 3-(22, 6, 1) with Aut(M22 ) as point
3-transitive full automorphism group as well as the Mathieu-Witt designs 4-(23, 7, 1)
and 5-(24, 8, 1) with M23 and M24 as point 4-transitive and point 5-transitive full
automorphism groups, respectively.
The five Mathieu groups were the first sporadic simple groups and were discovered by E. Mathieu [50, 51] over one hundred years ago. They are the only
finite 4- and 5-transitive permutation groups apart from the symmetric or alternating groups. The Steiner designs associated with the Mathieu groups were first
constructed by both R. D. Carmichael [28] and E. Witt [52], and their uniqueness
established up to isomorphism by Witt [53]. From the meanwhile various alternative constructions, we mention especially those of H. Lüneburg [54] and M. Aschbacher [55, Chap. 6]. However, the easiest way to construct and prove uniqueness
of the Mathieu-Witt designs is via coding theory, using the related binary and
ternary Golay codes (see Subsection 1.3.6).
Remark 1.2. By classifying Steiner designs which admit automorphism groups
with sufficiently strong symmetry properties, specific characterizations of the
Mathieu-Witt designs with their related Mathieu groups were obtained (see,
e.g., [56–61] and [62, Chap. 5] for a survey).
Remark 1.3. We mention that, in general, for t = 2 and 3, there are many infinite
classes of Steiner t-designs, but for t = 4 and 5 only a finite number are known.
Although L. Teirlinck [63] has shown that non-trivial t-designs exist for all values
of t, no Steiner t-designs have been constructed for t ≥ 6 so far.
In what follows, we need some helpful combinatorial tools:
A standard combinatorial double counting argument gives the following assertions.
Lemma 1.1. Let D = (X, B) be a t-(v, k, λ) design. For a positive integer s ≤ t,
let S ⊆ X with |S| = s. Then the total number λs of blocks containing all the points
of S is given by

v−s
λs = λ

t−s
.
k−s
t−s

In particular, for t ≥ 2, a t-(v, k, λ) design is also an s-(v, k, λs ) design.
For historical reasons, it is customary to set r := λ1 to be the total number of
blocks containing a given point (referring to the ‘replication number’ from statistical
design of experiments, one of the origins of designs theory).

The following theorem is an important result in the theory of designs, generally
known as Fisher’s Inequality.
Theorem 1.3. (Fisher [64]). If D = (X, B) is a non-trivial t-(v, k, λ) design with
t ≥ 2, then we have b ≥ v, that is, there are at least as many blocks as points in D.
We remark that equality holds exactly for square designs when t = 2. Obviously,
the equality v = b implies r = k by Lemma 1.2 (a).
1.3.2. Basic connections between codes and combinatorial designs
There is a rich and fruitful interplay between coding theory and design theory. In
particular, many t-designs have been found in the last decades by considering the
codewords of fixed weight in some special, often linear codes. As we will see in the
sequel, these codes typically exhibit a high degree of regularity. There is an amount
of literature [4, 7, 13, 31, 65–72] discussing to some extent in more detail various
relations between codes and designs.
For a codeword x ∈ Fn , the set
supp(x) := {i | xi 6= 0}
of all coordinate positions with non-zero coordinates is called the support of x. We
shall often form a t-design of a code in the following way: Given a (usually linear)
code of length n, which contains the zero vector, and non-zero weight w, we choose
as point set X the set of n coordinate positions of the code and as block set B the
supports of all codewords of weight w.
Since we do not allow repeated blocks, clearly only distinct representatives of
supports for codewords with the same supports are taken in the non-binary case.

is a generator matrix of a binary [7, 4, 3] Hamming code, which is the smallest
non-trivial Hamming code (see also Example 1.12). This code is a perfect singleerror-correcting code with weight distribution A0 = A7 = 1, A3 = A4 = 7. The
seven codewords of weight 3 are precisely the seven rows of the incidence matrix

of the Fano plane P G(2, 2) of Fig. 1.1. The supports of the seven codewords of
weight 4 yield the complementary 2-(7, 4, 2) design, i.e. the biplane of order 2.
Example 1.9. The matrix (I4 , J4 −I4 ), where J4 denotes the (4×4) all-one matrix,
generates the extended binary [8, 4, 4] Hamming code. This code is self-dual and
has weight distribution A0 = A8 = 1, A4 = 14. As any two codewords of weight
4 have distance at least 4, they have at most two 1’s in common, and hence no
codeword of weight 3 can
 appear as a subword of more than one codeword. On the
other hand, there are 83 = 56 words of weight 3 and each codeword of weight 4 has
four subwords of weight 3. Hence each codeword of weight 3 is a subword of exactly
one codeword of weight 4. Therefore, the supports of the fourteen codewords of
weight 4 form a 3-(8, 4, 1) design, which is the unique SQS(8) (cf. Example 1.5).
We give also a basic example of a non-linear code constructed from design theory.
Example 1.10. We take the rows of an incidence matrix of the (unique) Hadamard
2-(11, 5, 2) design, and adjoin the all-one codeword. Then, the twelve codewords
have mutual distance 6, and if we delete a coordinate, we get a binary non-linear
code of length 10 and minimum distance 5.
For a detailed description of the connection between non-linear codes and design
theory as well as the application of design theory in the area of (majority-logic)
decoding, the reader is referred, e.g., to [13, 71, 72].

Coding theory and algebraic combinatorics

Using highly transitive permutation groups, a further construction of designs
from codes can be described (see, e.g., [31]).
Theorem 1.4. Let C be a code which admits an automorphism group acting
t-homogeneously (in particular, t-transitively) on the set of coordinates. Then the
supports of the codewords of any non-zero weight form a t-design.
Example 1.11. The r-th order Reed-Muller (RM) code RM(r, m) of length 2m is a
Pr
m−r
binary [2m , i=0 m
] code with its codewords the value-vectors of all Boolean
i ,2
functions in m variables of degree at most r. These codes were first considered by
D. E. Muller [73] and I. S. Reed [74] in 1954. The dual of the Reed-Muller code
RM(r, m) is RM(m − r − 1, m). Clearly, the extended binary [8, 4, 4] Hamming code
in Example 1.9 is RM(1, 3).
Alternatively, a codeword in RM(r, m) can be viewed as the sum of characteristic
functions of subspaces of dimension at least m−r of the affine space AG(m, 2). Thus,
the full automorphism group of RM(r, m) contains the 3-transitive group AGL(m, 2)
of all affine transformations, and hence the codewords of any fixed non-zero weight
yield a 3-design.
1.3.3. Perfect codes and designs
The interplay between coding theory and combinatorial designs is most evidently
seen in the relationship between perfect codes and t-designs.
Theorem 1.5. (Assmus and Mattson [75]). A linear e-error-correcting code of
length n over Fq is perfect if and only if the supports of the codewords of minimum
weight d = 2e + 1 form an (e + 1)-(n, d, (q − 1)e ) design.
The question
“Does every Steiner triple system on n points extend to a Steiner quadruple
system on n + 1 points?”

which goes also back to Jakob Steiner [40], is still unresolved in general. However,
in terms of binary e-error-correcting codes, there is a positive answer.
Theorem 1.6. (Assmus and Mattson [75]). Let C be a (not necessarily linear)
binary e-error correcting code of length n, which contains the zero vector. Then C
is perfect if and only if the supports of the codewords of minimum weight d = 2e + 1
form a Steiner (e + 1)-(n, d, 1) design. Moreover, the supports of the minimum
codewords in the extended code C form a Steiner (e + 2)-(n + 1, d + 1, 1) design.
We have seen in Example 1.8 and Example 1.9 that the supports of the seven
codewords of weight 3 in the binary [7, 4, 3] Hamming code form a ST S(7), while
the supports of the fourteen codewords of weight 4 in the extended [8, 4, 4] Hamming

14

code yield a SQS(8). In view of the above theorems, we get more generally:
Example 1.12. Let n := (q m − 1)/(q − 1). We consider a (m × n)-matrix H over
Fq such that no two columns of H are linearly dependent. Then H clearly is a
parity check matrix of an [n, n − m, 3] code, which is the Hamming code over Fq .
The number of its codewords is q n−m , and for any codeword x, we have S1 (x) =
1 + n(q − 1) = q m . Hence, by the Sphere Packing Bound (Theorem 1.1), this code is
perfect, and the supports of codewords of minimum weight 3 form a 2-(n, 3, q − 1)
design. Furthermore, in a binary [2m − 1, 2m − 1 − m, 3] Hamming code the supports
of codewords of weight 3 form a ST S(2m − 1), and the supports of the codewords
of weight 4 in the extended code yield a SQS(2m).
Note. The Hamming codes were developed by R. W. Hamming [2] in the mid
1940’s, who was employed at Bell Laboratories, and addressed a need for error
correction in his work on the primitive computers of the time. We remark that
the extended binary [2m , 2m − m − 1, 4] Hamming code is the Reed-Muller code
RM(m − 2, m).
Example 1.13. The binary Golay code is a [23, 12, 7] code, while the ternary Golay
code is a [11, 6, 5] code. For both codes, the parameters imply equality in the
Sphere Packing Bound, and hence these codes are perfect. We will discuss later
various constructions of these some of the most famous codes (see Example 1.14 and
Construction 1.12). By the above theorems, the supports of codewords of minimum
weight 7 in the binary [23, 12, 7] Golay code form a Steiner 4-(23, 7, 1) design, and
the supports of the codewords of weight 8 in the extended binary [24, 12, 8] Golay
code give a Steiner 5-(24, 8, 1) design. The supports of codewords of minimum
weight 5 in the ternary [11, 6, 5] Golay code yield a 3-(11, 5, 4) design. It can be
shown (e.g., via Theorem 1.4) that this is indeed a Steiner 4-(11, 5, 1) design. We
will see in Example 1.15 that the supports of the codewords of weight 6 in the
extended ternary [12, 6, 6] Golay code give a Steiner 5-(12, 6, 1) design; thus the
above results are not best possible.
Note. The Golay codes were discovered by M. J. E. Golay [76] in 1949 in the
process of extending Hamming’s construction. They have numerous practical realworld applications, e.g., the use of the extended binary Golay code in the Voyager
spacecraft program during the early 1980’s or in contemporary standard Automatic
Link Establishment (ALE) in High Frequency (HF) data communication for Forward Error Correction (FEC).
Remark 1.4. It is easily seen from their construction that the Hamming codes are
unique (up to equivalence). It was shown by V. Pless [77] that this is also true for the
Golay codes. Moreover, the binary and ternary Golay codes are the only non-trivial
perfect e-error-correcting codes with e > 1 over any field Fq . Using integral roots of
the Lloyd polynomial, this remarkable fact was proven by A. Tietäväinen [78] and

15

Coding theory and algebraic combinatorics

J. H. van Lint [79], and independently by V. A. Zinov’ev and V. K. Leont’ev [80].
M. R. Best [81] and Y. Hong [82] extended this result to arbitrary alphabets for
e > 2. For a thorough account of perfect codes, we refer to [83] and [84, Chap. 11].
As trivial perfect codes can only form trivial designs, we have (up to equivalence)
a complete list of non-trivial linear perfect codes with their associated designs:

There are various constructions of non-linear single-error-correcting perfect
codes. For more details, see, e.g., [9, 13, 71, 72, 85] and references therein. However,
a classification of these codes seems out of reach at present, although some progress
has been made recently, see, for instance [86–88].
Remark 1.5. The long-standing question whether every Steiner triple system of
order 2m − 1 occurs in a perfect code has been answered recently in the negative.
Relying on the classification [89] of the Steiner quadruple systems of order 16, it was
shown in [90] that the unique anti-Pasch Steiner triple system of order 15 provides
a counterexample.
Remark 1.6. Due to the close relationship between perfect codes and some of
the most interesting designs, several natural extensions of perfect codes have been
examined in this respect: Nearly perfect codes [91], and the more general class
of uniformly packed codes [92, 93], were studied extensively and eventually lead
to t-designs. H. C. A. van Tilborg [94] showed that e-error correcting uniformly
packed codes do not exist for e > 3, and classified those for e ≤ 3. For more
details, see [4, 10, 13, 94]. The concept of diameter perfect codes [95, 96] is related
particularly to Steiner designs. For further generalizations of perfect codes, see
e.g., [84, Chap. 11] and [13, Chap. 6].
1.3.4. The Assmus-Mattson Theorem and analogues
We consider in this subsection one of the most fundamental results in the interplay
of coding theory and design theory. We start by introducing two important classes
of codes.
Let q be an odd prime power. We define a function χ (the so-called Legendresymbol ) on Fq by

 0, if x = 0
χ(x) := 1, if x is a non-zero square

−1, otherwise.

16

Michael Huber

We note that χ is a character on the multiplicative group of Fq . Using the elements
of Fq as row and column labels ai and aj (0 ≤ i, j < q), respectively, a matrix
Q = (qij ) of order q can be defined by
qij := χ(aj − ai ).

(1.1)

If q is a prime, then Q is a circulant matrix. We call a matrix


0
1 ··· 1

 χ(−1)


Cq+1 :=  .

.
 .
Q 
χ(−1)
of order q + 1 a Paley matrix . These matrices were constructed by R. A. Paley in
1933 and are a specific type of conference matrices, which have their origin in the
application to conference telephone circuits.
Construction 1.7. Let n be an odd prime, and q be a quadratic residue (mod n),
i.e. q (n−1)/2 ≡ 1 (mod n). The quadratic residue code (or QR code) of length n
√
over Fq is a [n, (n + 1)/2] code with minimum weight d ≥ n (so-called Square
Root Bound ). It can be generated by the (0, 1)-circulant matrix of order n with top
row the incidence vector of the non-zero quadratic residues (mod n). These codes
are a special class of cyclic codes and were first constructed by A. M. Gleason in
1964. For n ≡ 3 (mod 4), the extended quadratic residue code is self-dual. We note
for the important binary case that q is a quadratic residue (mod n) if and only if
n ≡ ±1 (mod 8).
Note. By a theorem of A. M. Gleason and E. Prange, the full automorphism group
of an extended quadratic residue code of length n contains the group P SL(2, n) of
all linear fractional transformations whose determinant is a non-zero square.
Example 1.14. The binary [7, 4, 3] Hamming code is a quadratic residue code of
length 7 over F2 . The binary [23, 12, 7] Golay code is a quadratic residue code of
length 23 over F2 , while the ternary [11, 6, 5] Golay code is a quadratic residue code
of length 11 over F3 .
Construction 1.8. For q ≡ −1 (mod 6) a prime power, the Pless symmetry code
Sym2(q+1) of dimension q + 1 is a ternary [2(q + 1), q + 1] code with generator matrix
T
= −Iq+1
G2(q+1) := (Iq+1 , Cq+1 ), where Cq+1 is a Paley matrix. Since Cq+1 Cq+1
(over F3 ) for q ≡ −1 (mod 3), the code Sym2(q+1) is self-dual. This infinite family
of cyclic codes were introduced by V. Pless [97, 98] in 1972. We note that the first
symmetry code S12 is equivalent to the extended [12, 6, 6] Golay code.
The celebrated Assmus-Mattson Theorem gives a sufficient condition for the
codewords of constant weight in a linear code to form a t-design.

Coding theory and algebraic combinatorics

17

Theorem 1.9. (Assmus and Mattson [99]). Let C be an [n, k, d] code over Fq and
+q−2
<
C ⊥ be the [n, n−k, e] dual code. Let n0 be the largest integer such that n0 − n0q−1
⊥
d, and define m0 similarly for the dual code C , whereas if q = 2, we assume that
n0 = m0 = n. For some integer t with 0 < t < d, let us suppose that there are
at most d − t non-zero weights w in C ⊥ with w ≤ n − t. Then, for any weight
v with d ≤ v ≤ n0 , the supports of codewords of weight v in C form a t-design.
Furthermore, for any weight w with e ≤ w ≤ min{n − t, m0 }, the support of the
codewords w in C ⊥ also form a t-design.
The proof of the theorem involves a clever use of the MacWilliams relations
(Theorem 1.2). Along with these, Lemma 1.1 and the immediate observation that
codewords of weight less than n0 with the same support must be scalar multiples of
each other, form the basis of the proof (for a detailed proof, see, e.g., [4, Chap. 14]).
Remark 1.7. Until this result by E. F. Assmus, Jr. and H. F. Mattson, Jr. in
1969, only very few 5-designs were known: the Mathieu-Witt designs 5-(12, 6, 1)
and 5-(24, 8, 1), the 5-(24, 8, 48) design formed by the codewords of weight 12 (the
dodecads) in the extended binary Golay code, as well as 5-(12, 6, 2) and 5-(24, 8, 2)
designs which had been found without using coding theory. However, by using the
Assmus-Mattson Theorem, it was possible to find a number of new 5-designs. In
particular, the theorem is most useful when the dual code has relatively few nonzero weights. Nevertheless, it has not been possible to detect t-designs for t > 5 by
the Assmus-Mattson Theorem.
We illustrate in the following examples some applications of the theorem.
Example 1.15. The extended binary [24, 12, 8] Golay code is self-dual (cf. Construction 1.7) and has codewords of weight 0, 8, 12, 16, and 24 in view of Theorem 1.2. For t = 5, we obtain the Steiner 5-(24, 8, 1) design as in Example 1.13. In
the self-dual extended ternary [12, 6, 6] Golay code all codewords are divisible by
3, and hence for t = 5, the supports of the codewords of weight 6 form a Steiner
5-(12, 6, 1) design.
Example 1.16. The extended quadratic residue code of length 48 over F2 is selfdual with minimum distance 12. By Theorem 1.2, it has codewords of weight
0, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 48. For t = 5, each of the values v = 12, 16, 20, or 24
yields a different 5-design and its complementary design.
Example 1.17. The Pless symmetry code Sym36 of dimension 18 is self-dual
(cf. Construction 1.8) with minimum distance 12. The supports of codewords of
weight 12, 15, 18, and 21 yield 5-designs together with their complementary designs.
Remark 1.8. We give an overview of the state of knowledge concerning codes over
Fq with their associated 5-designs (cf. also the tables in [13, Chap. 16], [65, 71, 72]).
In fact, these codes are all self-dual. Trivial designs as well as complementary
designs are omitted.

codes of length 24 yield (non-isomorphic) 5-(24, 10, 36) designs. We further note
that the quadratic residue codes and the Pless symmetry codes listed in the table
with the same parameters are not equivalent as shown in [98] by inspecting specific
elements of the automorphism group P SL(2, q).
Remark 1.9. The concept of the weight enumerator can be generalized to nonlinear codes (so-called distance enumerator ), which leads to an analog of the
MacWilliams relations as well as to similar results to the Assmus-Mattson Theorem for non-linear codes (see [17, 18, 105] and Subsection 1.3.8). The question
whether there is an analogous result to the Assmus-Mattson theorem for codes over
Z4 proposed in [102] was answered in the affirmative in [106]. Further generalizations of the Assmus-Mattson Theorem are known, see in particular [107–113].
1.3.5. Codes and finite geometries
Let A be an incidence matrix of a projective plane P G(2, n) of order n. When we
2
consider the subspace C of F2n +n+1 spanned by the rows of A, we obtain for odd n
only the [n2 + n + 1, n2 + n, 2] code consisting of all codewords of even weight. The
case for even n is more interesting, in particular if n ≡ 2 (mod 4).
Theorem 1.10. For n ≡ 2 (mod 4), the rows of an incidence matrix of a projective
plane P G(2, n) of order n generate a binary code C of dimension (n2 + n + 2)/2,
and the extended code C is self-dual.
In a projective plane P G(2, n) of even order n, there exist sets of n + 2 points,
no three of which are collinear, and which are called hyperovals (sometimes just
ovals, cf. [46]). This gives furthermore
Theorem 1.11. The code C has minimum weight n+1. Moreover, the codewords of
minimum weight correspond to the lines and those of weight n + 2 to the hyperovals
of P G(2, n).
Remark 1.10. The above two theorems arose in the context of the examination of
the existence of a projective plane of order 10 (cf. Remark 1.1; for detailed proofs
see, e.g., [4, Chapt. 13]). Assuming the existence of such a plane, the obtained
properties of the corresponding code lead to very extensive computer searches. For
example, in an early crucial step, it was shown [114] that this code could not have
codewords of weight 15. On the various attempts to attack the problem and the final
verification of the non-existence, we refer to [44, 115, 116] as well as [22, Chap. 17]
and [35, Chap. 12].
Note. We note that at present the Fano plane is the only known projective plane
with order n ≡ 2 (mod 4).

For further accounts on codes and finite geometries, the reader is referred, e.g.,
to [66, Chap. 5 and 6] and [3, 4, 67, 116–119], as well as [120] from a more grouptheoretical perspective and [121] with an emphasis on quadratic forms over F2 .
1.3.6. Golay codes, Mathieu-Witt designs, and Mathieu groups
We highlight some of the remarkable and natural interrelations between the Golay
codes, the Mathieu-Witt designs, and the Mathieu groups.
There are various different constructions for the Golay codes besides the description as quadratic residue codes in Example 1.14. We briefly illustrate some
exemplary constructions. For further details and more constructions, we refer
to [122], [13, Chap. 20], [4, Chap. 11], and [123, Chap. 11].
Construction 1.12.
• Starting with the zero vector in F24
2 , a linear code of length 24 can be obtained
by successively taking the lexicographically least binary codeword which has
not been used and which has distance at least 8 to any predecessor. At the end
of this process, we have 4096 codewords which form the extended binary Golay
code. This construction is due to J. H. Conway and N. J. A. Sloane [124].
• Let A be an incidence matrix of the (unique) 2-(11, 6, 3) design. Then G :=
(I12 , P ) with


0 1 ··· 1
1



P :=  .

 ..
A 
1

is a (12 × 24)-matrix in which each row (except the top row) has eight 1’s, and
generates the extended binary Golay code.
• Let N be an (12 × 12)-adjacency matrix of the graph formed by the vertices
and edges of the regular icosahedron. Then G := (I12 , J12 − N ) is a generator
matrix for the extended binary Golay code.
• We recall that F4 = {0, 1, ω, ω 2} is the field of four elements with ω 2 = ω + 1.
The hexacode is the [6, 3, 4] code over F4 generated by the matrix G := (I3 , P )
with


1 ω2 ω
P :=  1 ω ω 2  .
1 1 1
The extended binary Golay code can be defined by identifying each codeword
with a binary (4 × 6)-matrix M (with rows m0 , m1 , m2 , m3 ), satisfying
(i) each column of M has the same parity as the first row m0 ,
(ii) the sum m1 + ωm2 + ω 2 m3 lies in the hexacode.

Coding theory and algebraic combinatorics

21

This description is essentially equivalent to the computational tool MOG (Miracle Octad Generator) of R. T. Curtis [125]. The construction via the hexacode
is by Conway, see, e.g., [123, Chap. 11].
• Let Q be the circulant matrix of order 5 defined by Eq. (1.1). Then G := (I6 , P ),
where P is the matrix Q bordered on top with a row of 1’s, is a generator matrix
of the ternary Golay code.
Remark 1.11. Referring to Example 1.7, we note that the automorphism groups
of the Golay codes are isomorphic to the particular Mathieu groups, as was first
pointed out in [101, 126]. Moreover, the Golay codes are related in a particularly
deep and interesting way to a larger family of sporadic finite simple groups (cf.,
e.g., [55]).
Remark 1.12. We have seen in Example 1.13 that the supports of the codewords
of weight 8 in the extended binary [24, 12, 8] Golay code form a Steiner 5-(24, 8, 1)
design. The uniqueness of the large Mathieu-Witt design (up to isomorphism) can
be established easily via coding theory (cf. Example 1.7). The main part is to show
that any binary code of 4096 codewords, including the zero vector, of length 24 and
minimum distance 8, is linear and can be determined uniquely (up to equivalence).
For further details, in particular for a uniqueness proof of the small Mathieu-Witt
designs, see, e.g., [70, 122] and [4, Chap. 11].
1.3.7. Golay codes, Leech lattice, kissing numbers, and sphere packings
Sphere packings closely connect mathematics and information theory via the sampling theorem as observed by C. E. Shannon [1] in his classical article of 1948.
Rephrased in a more geometric language, this can be expressed as follows:
“Nearly equal signals are represented by neighboring points, so to keep the signals
distinct, Shannon represents them by n-dimensional ‘billiard balls’, and is therefore led to ask: what is the best way to pack ‘billiard balls’ in n dimensions?” [127]

One of the most remarkable lattices, the Leech lattice in R24 , plays a crucial role
in classical sphere packings. We recall that a lattice in Rn is a discrete subgroup
of Rn of rank n. The extended binary Golay code led to the discovery by John
Leech [128] of the 24-dimensional Euclidean lattice named after him. There are
various constructions besides the usual ones from the binary and ternary Golay
codes in the meantime, see, e.g., [129], [123, Chap. 24]. We outline some of the
fundamental connections between sphere packings and the Leech lattice.
The Kissing Number Problem deals with the maximal number τn of equal size
non-overlapping spheres in the n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn that can touch
a given sphere of the same size. Only a few of these numbers are actually known.
For dimensions n = 1, 2, 3, the classical solutions are: τ1 = 2, τ2 = 6, τ3 = 12.
The number τ3 was the subject of a famous controversy between Isaac Newton and

22

Michael Huber

David Gregory in 1694, and was finally verified only in 1953 by K. Schütte and
B. L. van der Waerden [130]. Using an approach initiated by P. Delsarte [18, 131]
in the early 1970’s which gives linear programming upper bounds for binary errorcorrecting codes and for spherical codes [132] (cf. Subsection 1.3.8), A. M. Odlyzko
and N. J. A. Sloane [133], and independently V. I. Levenshtein [134], proved that
τ8 = 240 and τ24 = 196560. These exact solutions are the number of non-zero
vectors of minimal length in the root lattice E8 and in the Leech lattice, respectively.
By extending and improving Delsarte’s method, O. R. Musin [135] verified in 2003
that τ4 = 24, which is the number of non-zero vectors of minimal length in the root
lattice D4 .
The Sphere Packing Problem asks for the maximal density of a packing of equal
size non-overlapping spheres in the n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn . A sphere
packing is called a lattice packing if the centers of the spheres form a lattice in Rn .
The Leech lattice is the unique densest lattice packing (up to scaling and isometries)
in R24 , as was shown by H. Cohn and A. Kumar [136, 137] recently in 2004, again
by a modification of Delsarte’s method. Moreover, they showed that the density of
any sphere packing in R24 cannot exceed the one given by the Leech lattice by a
factor of more than 1 + 1.65 · 10−30 (via a computer calculation). The proof is based
on the work [138] by Cohn and N. D. Elkies in 2003 in which linear programming
bounds for the Sphere Packing Problem are introduced and new upper bounds on
the density of sphere packings in Rn with dimension n ≤ 36 are proven.
For further details on the Kissing Number Problem and the Sphere Packing
Problem, see [123, Chap. 1], [127, 139], [14], as well as the survey articles [140–142].
For an on-line database on lattices, see [143].
1.3.8. Codes and association schemes
Any finite nonempty subset of the unit sphere S n−1 in the n-dimensional Euclidean
space Rn is called a spherical code. These codes have many practical applications,
e.g., in the design of signals for data transmission and storage. As a special class of
spherical codes, spherical designs were introduced by P. Delsarte, J.-M. Goethals
and J. Seidel [132] in 1977 as analogs on S n−1 of the classical combinatorial designs.
For example, in S 2 the tetrahedron is a spherical 2-design; the octahedron and the
cube are spherical 3-designs, and the icosahedron and the dodecahedron are spherical 5-designs. In order to obtain the linear programming upper bound mentioned
in the previous subsection, Krawtchouk polynomials were involved in the case of
binary error-correcting codes and Gegenbauer polynomials in the case of spherical
codes.
However, Delsarte’s approach was indeed much more general and far-reaching.
He developed for association schemes, which have their origin in the statistical
theory of design of experiments, a theory to unify many of the objects we have
been addressing in this chapter. We give a formal definition of association schemes

Coding theory and algebraic combinatorics

23

in the sense of Delsarte [18] as well as introduce the Hamming and the Johnson
schemes as important examples of the two fundamental classes of P -polynomial and
Q-polynomial association schemes.
Definition 1.3. A d-class association scheme is a finite point set X together with
d + 1 relations Ri on X, satisfying
(i) {R0 , R1 , . . . , Rd } is a partition of X × X,
(ii) R0 = {(x, x) | x ∈ X},
(iii) for each i with 0 ≤ i ≤ d, there exists a j with 0 ≤ j ≤ d such that (x, y) ∈ Ri
implies (y, x) ∈ Rj ,
(iv) for any (x, y) ∈ Rk , the number pkij of points z ∈ X with (x, z) ∈ Ri and
(z, y) ∈ Rj depends only on i, j and k,
(v) pkij = pkji for all i, j and k.
The numbers pkij are called the intersection numbers of the association scheme. Two
points x, y ∈ X are called i-th associates if {x, y} ∈ Ri .
Example 1.18. The Hamming scheme H(n, q) has as point set X the set Fn of all
n-tuples from a q-symbol alphabet; two n-tuples are i-th associates if their Hamming
distance is i. The Johnson scheme J(v, k), with k ≤ 12 v, has as point set X the
set of all k-element subsets of a set of size v; two k-element subset S1 , S2 are i-th
associates if |S1 ∩ S2 | = k − i.
Delsarte introduced the Hamming and Johnson schemes as settings for the classical concept of error-correcting codes and combinatorial t-designs, respectively. In
this manner, certain results become formally dual, like the Sphere Packing Bound
(Theorem 1.1) and Fisher’s Inequality (Theorem 1.3).
For a more extended treatment of association schemes, the reader is referred,
e.g., to [144–148], [4, Chap. 17], [13, Chap. 21], and in particular to [149, 150] with an
emphasis on the close connection between coding theory and associations schemes.
For a survey on spherical designs, see [21, Chap. VI.54].
1.4. Directions for further research
We present in this section a collection of significant open problems and challenges
concerning future research.
Problem 1.1. (cf. [40]). Does every Steiner triple system on n points extend to a
Steiner quadruple system on n + 1 points?
Problem 1.2. Does there exist any non-trivial Steiner 6-design?
Problem 1.3. (cf. [13, p. 180]). Find all non-linear single-error-correcting perfect
codes over Fq .

24

Michael Huber

Problem 1.4. (cf. [6, p. 106]). Characterize codes where all codewords of the same
weight (or of minimum weight) form a non-trivial design.
Problem 1.5. (cf. [6, p. 116]). Find a proof of the non-existence of a projective
plane of order 10 without the help of a computer or with an easily reproducible
computer program.
Problem 1.6. Does there exist any finite projective plane of order 12, or of any
other order that is neither a prime power nor covered by the Bruck-Ryser Theorem
(cf. Remark 1.1)?
Problem 1.7. Does the root lattice D4 give the unique kissing number configuration in R4 ?
Problem 1.8. Solve the Kissing Number Problem in n dimensions for any n > 4
apart from n = 8 and 24. For presently known lower and upper bounds, we refer
to [151] and [152], respectively. Also any improvements of these bounds would be
desirable.
Problem 1.9. (cf. [138, Conj. 8.1]). Verify the conjecture that the Leech lattice is
the unique densest sphere packing in R24 .
1.5. Conclusions
Over the last sixty years a substantial amount of research has been inspired by
the various interactions of coding theory and algebraic combinatorics. The fruitful
interplay often reveals the high degree of regularity of both the codes and the
combinatorial structures. This has lead to a vivid area of research connecting closely
mathematics with information and coding theory. The emerging methods can be
applied sometimes surprisingly effectively, e.g., in view of the recent advances on
kissing numbers and sphere packings.
A further development of this beautiful interplay as well as its application to
concrete problems would be desirable, certainly also in view of the various still open
and long-standing problems.

1.7. Exercises
(1) Verify (numerically) that the Steiner quadruple system SQS(8) of order 8
(cf. Example 1.5) has 14 blocks, and that the Mathieu-Witt design 5-(24, 8, 1)
(cf. Example 1.7) has 759 blocks.
(2) What are the parameters of the 2-design consisting of the points and hyperplanes (i.e. the (d−2)-dimensional projective subspaces) of the projective space
P G(d − 1, q)?

(3) Does there exist a self-dual [8, 4] code over the finite field F2 ?

(4) Show that the ternary [11, 6, 5] Golay code has 132 codewords of weight 5.
(5) Compute the weight distribution of the binary [23, 12, 7] Golay code.
(6) Show that any binary code of 4096 codewords, including the zero vector, of
length 24 and minimum distance 8 is linear.
(7) Give a proof for the Sphere Packing Bound (cf. Theorem 1.1).
(8) Give a proof for Fisher’s Inequality (cf. Theorem 1.3).
(9) Show that a binary code generated by the rows of an incidence matrix of any
projective plane P G(2, n) of even order n has dimension at most (n2 + n + 2)/2
(cf. Theorem 1.10).
(10) (Todd’s Lemma). In the Mathieu-Witt design 5-(24, 8, 1), if B1 and B2 are
blocks (octads) meeting in four points, then B1 + B2 is also a block.
Solutions:
ad (1): By Lemma 1.2 (b), we have to calculate b = 8·7·6
4·3·2 = 14 in the case of the
24·23·22·21·20
= 759 in the case of
Steiner quadruple system SQS(8), and b =
8·7·6·5·4
the Mathieu-Witt design 5-(24, 8, 1).
ad (2): Starting from Example 1.3, we obtain via counting arguments (or by
using the transitivity properties of the general linear group) that the
points and hyperplanes of the projective space P G(d − 1, q) form a
d
−1 qd−1 −1 qd−2 −1
, q−1 , q−1 ) design.
2-( qq−1
ad (3): Yes, the extended binary [8, 4, 4] Hamming code is self-dual (cf. Example 1.9).
ad (4): Since the ternary [11, 6, 5] Golay code is perfect (cf. Example 1.13), every word
11
of weight
 53 in F3 has distance 2 to a codeword of weight 5. Thus A5 =
11
3
2 · 3 / 2 = 132.
ad (5): The binary [23, 12, 7] Golay code contains the zero vector and is perfect. This
determines the weight distribution as follows A0 = A23 = 1, A7 = A16 = 253,
A8 = A15 = 506, A11 = A12 = 1288.

ad (6): Let C denote a binary code of 4096 codewords, including the zero vector, of
length 24 and minimum distance 8. Deleting any coordinate leads to a code

26

Michael Huber

which has the same weight distribution as the code given in Exercise (5). Hence,
the code C only has codewords of weight 0, 8, 12, 16 and 24. This is still true
if the code C is translated by any codeword (i.e. C + x for any x ∈ C). Thus,
the distances between pairs of codewords are also 0, 8, 12, 16 and 24. Therefore,
the standard inner product hx, yi vanishes for any two codewords x, y ∈ C,
and hence C is self-orthogonal. For cardinality reasons, we conclude that C is
self-dual and hence in particular linear.

Pe
ad (7): The sum i=0 ni (q − 1)i counts the number of words in a sphere of radius
e. As the spheres
of radius e about distinct codewords are disjoint, we obtain

Pe
|C| · i=0 ni (q − 1)i words. Clearly, this number cannot exceed the total
number q n of words, and the claim follows.
ad (8): As a non-trivial t-design with t ≥ 2 is also a non-trivial 2-design by Lemma 1.1,
it is sufficient to prove the assertion for an arbitrary non-trivial 2-(v, k, λ) design
D. Let A be an incidence matrix of D as defined in Subsection 1.3.1. Clearly,
the (i, k)-th entry
(AAt )ik =

b
X
j=1

(A)ij (At )jk =

b
X

aij akj

j=1

of the (v × v)-matrix AAt is the total number of blocks containing both xi and
xk , and is thus equal to r if i = k, and to λ if i 6= k. Hence
AAt = (r − λ)I + λJ,

where I denotes the (v × v)-unit matrix and J the (v × v)-matrix with all entries
equal to 1. Using elementary row and column operations, it follows easily that
det(AAt ) = rk(r − λ)v−1 .

Thus AAt is non-singular (i.e. its determinant is non-zero) as r = λ would
imply v = k by Lemma 1.1, yielding that the design is trivial. Therefore, the
matrix AAt has rank(A) = v. But, if b < v, then rank(A) ≤ b < v, and thus
rank(AAt ) < v, a contradiction. It follows that b ≥ v, proving the claim.

ad (9): Let C denote a binary code generated by the rows of an incidence matrix of
P G(2, n). By assumption n is even, and hence the extended code C must be
self-orthogonal. Therefore, the dimension of C is at most n2 + n + 2/2.

ad (10): For given blocks B1 = {01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08} and B2 = {01, 02, 03, 04,
09, 10, 11, 12} in the Mathieu-Witt design 5-(24, 8, 1), let us assume that B1 +B2
is not a block. The block B3 which contains {05, 06, 07, 08, 09} must contain
just one more point of B2 , say B3 = {05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 13, 14}. Similarly,
B4 = {05, 06, 07, 08, 11, 12, 15, 16} is the block containing {05, 06, 07, 08, 11}.
But hence, it is impossible to find a block which contains {05, 06, 07, 09, 11}
and intersects with Bi , 1 ≤ i ≤ 4, in 0, 2 or 4 points. Therefore, we obtain
a contradiction as there must be a block containing any five points by Definition 1.2.
