Abstract
Inner and outer bounds are derived on the optimal performance of fixed length block codes on discrete memoryless
channels with feedback and errors-and-erasures decoding. First an inner bound is derived using a two phase encoding
scheme with communication and control phases together with the optimal decoding rule for the given encoding scheme,
among decoding rules that can be represented in terms of pairwise comparisons between the messages. Then an outer
bound is derived using a generalization of the straight-line bound to errors-and-erasures decoders and the optimal error
exponent trade off of a feedback encoder with two messages. In addition upper and lower bounds are derived, for the
optimal erasure exponent of error free block codes in terms of the rate. Finally we present a proof of the fact that the
optimal trade off between error exponents of a two message code does not increase with feedback on DMCs.

I. I NTRODUCTION :
Shannon showed in [30] that the capacity of discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) does not increase even when a
noiseless and delay free feedback link is available from the receiver to the transmitter. On symmetric DMCs the sphere
packing exponent bounds the error exponent of fixed length block codes from above, as shown by Dobrushin1 in [11].
Thus relaxations like errors-and-erasures decoding or variable length coding are needed for feedback to increase the
error exponent of block codes at rates larger than the critical rate on symmetric DMCs. In this work we investigate one
such relaxation, namely errors-and-erasures decoding and find inner and outer bounds to the optimal error exponent
erasure exponent trade off.
Finding the optimal encoding and decoding schemes, and hence finding optimal performance by characterizing
the surface of achievable error exponent erasure exponent pairs is an important motivation for the investigation of
errors-and-erasure decoding. Note, however, that finding the optimal performance with erasures will implicitly solve
the problem of finding the optimal feedback encoder and determining the error exponent for the erasure free fixed
length block codes with feedback which is a long standing open problem. Finding the optimal performance, however,
is far from being the only important aspect of the problem. Determining the performance of feedback encoding
schemes that are easier to implement, more robust to the degradations of the feedback link and bounding the loss
in the performance compared to the more complicated encoding schemes are both important tasks practically and
interesting ones intellectually. This will be our aim in this paper. We will first analyze the performance of a two phase
encoding scheme inspired by the optimal encoding schemes for variable length block codes and derive inner bounds
to the optimal performance. Then we will derive outer bounds to the performance of general feedback encoding
schemes with erasures and quantify the loss of performance by restricting ourselves to the above mentioned two
phase schemes. This analysis complements the research on two related block coding schemes: variable length block
coding and errors-and-erasures decoding for block codes without feedback. We start with a very brief overview of
the previous work on these problems to motivate our investigation further.
Burnashev [3], [4], [5] was the first one to consider variable-length block codes with feedback, instead of fixed
length ones. He obtained the exact expression for the error exponent at all rates. Later Yamamoto and Itoh, [34],
suggested a coding scheme which achieves the best error exponent for variable-length block codes with feedback
by using a fixed length block code with an errors-and-erasures decoding and repeating the same codeword until a
non-erasure decoding occurs.2 In fact any fixed length block code with erasures can be used in this repetitive fashion,

Later Haroutunian, [17], established an upper bound on the error exponent of block codes with feedback. This upper bound is equal to
sphere packing exponent for symmetric channels but it is strictly larger than the sphere packing exponent for non-symmetric channels.

Including erasures will not increase the exponent for variable-length block codes with feedback.

like it was done in [34], to get a variable length block code with essentially the same error exponent as the original
fixed length block code. Thus [3] can be reinterpreted to give an upper bound to the error exponent achievable by
fixed length block codes with erasures. Furthermore this upper bound is achieved by the fixed length block codes with
erasures described in [34], when erasure probability is decaying to zero subexponentially with block length. However
the techniques used in this line of work are insufficient for deriving proper inner or outer bounds for the situation
when erasure probability is decaying exponentially with block length. As explained in the following paragraph the case
with strictly positive erasure exponent is important both for engineering applications and for a better understanding of
soft decoding with feedback. Our investigation provides proper tools for such an analysis, results in inner and outer
bounds to the trade off between error and erasure exponents, while recovering all previously known results for the
zero erasure exponent case.
When considered together with higher layers, the codes in the physical layer are part of a variable length/delay
communication scheme with feedback. However in the physical layer itself fixed length block codes are used instead
of variable length ones because of their amenability to modular design and robustness against the noise in the feedback
link. In such an architecture retransmissions affect the performance of higher layers. The average transmission time is
only a first order measure of this effect: as long as the erasure probability is vanishing with increasing block length,
average transmission time will essentially be equal to the block length of the fixed length block code. Thus with
an analysis like the one in [34], the cost of retransmissions are ignored as long as the erasure probability goes to
zero with increasing block length. In a communication system with multiple layers, however, retransmissions usually
have costs beyond their effect on average transmission time, which are described by constraints on the probability
distribution of the decoding time. Knowledge of error erasure exponent trade off is useful in coming up with designs
to meet those constraints. An example of this phenomena is variable length block coding schemes with hard deadlines
for decoding time, which has already been investigated by Gopala et. al. [16] for block codes without feedback.
They have used a block coding scheme with erasures and they resend the message whenever an erasure occurs. But
because of the hard deadline, they employ this scheme only for some fixed number of trials. If all those trials fail,
i.e. lead to an erasure, they use a non-erasure block code. Using the error exponent erasure exponent trade off they
were able to obtain the best over all error performance for the given architecture.
This brings us to the second line of research we complement with our investigation: errors-and-erasures decoding
for block codes without feedback. Forney [14] was the first one to consider errors-and-erasures decoding without
feedback. He obtained an achievable trade off between the exponents of error and erasure probabilities. Then Csiszár
and Körner, [10] achieved the same performance using universal coding and decoding algorithms. Later Telatar and
Gallager, [33], introduced a strict improvement on certain channels over the results presented in [14] and [10]. Recently
there has been a revived interest in the errors-and-erasures decoding for universally achievable performances [22], [21],
for alternative methods of analysis [20], for extensions to the channels with side information [27] and implementation
with linear block codes [18]. The encoding schemes in these codes do not have access to any feedback. However if
the transmitter can learn whether the decoded message was an erasure or not, it can resend the message whenever it is
erased. Because of this block retransmission variant, these problems are sometimes called decision feedback problems.
We complement the results on the error exponent erasure exponent trade off without feedback and the results about
error exponent of variable length block codes with feedback, by finding inner and outer bounds to the error exponent
erasure exponent trade off of fixed length block codes with feedback. We first introduce our model and notation
in Section II. Then in Section III we derive a lower bound using a two phase coding algorithm similar to the one
described by Yamamoto and Ito in [34] and decoding rule and analysis techniques, inspired by Telatar’s in [32] for
the non-feedback case. Note that the analysis and the decoding rule in [32] is tailored for a single phase scheme and
without feedback and the two phase scheme of [34] is tuned specifically to zero-erasure exponent; coming up with
framework in which both of the ideas can be used efficiently is the main technical challenge here. In Section IV we
first extend the straight line bound idea introduced by Shannon, Gallager and Berlekamp in [31] to block codes with
erasures. Then we use it together with the outer bound on the error exponent trade off between two codewords with
feedback to establish an outer bound for the error exponent of fixed length block codes with feedback and erasures.
In Section V we first introduce error free block codes with erasures and discuss their relation to the fixed length block
codes with errors-and-erasures-decoding, and then we present inner and outer bounds to the erasure exponent of error
free block codes and point out its relation to the error exponent erasure exponent trade off.
Before presenting our analysis, let us make a brief digression and discuss two channel models in which the use
2

of feedback had been investigated for block codes without erasures. First channel model is the well known additive
white Gaussian noise channel (AWGNC) model. In AWGNCs if the power constraint P is on the expected value
of the energy spent on a block E[Sn ] i.e. power constraint is of the form E[Sn ] ≤ Pn, the error probability can be
made to decay faster than any exponential function with block length n. Schalkwijk and Kailath suggested a coding
algorithm in [29] which achieves a doubly exponential decay in error probability for continuous time AWGNCs, i.e.
infinite bandwidth case. Later Schalkwijk [28] modified that scheme to achieve the same performance in discrete time
AWGNCs, i.e. finite bandwidth case. Concatenating Schalkwijk and Kailath scheme with pulse amplitude modulation
stages, gives a multi-fold exponential decrease in the error probability [26], [35], [15]. However this behavior relies
on the absence of any amplitude limit, the particular form of the power constraint and the noise free nature of the
feedback link. First of all, as observed in [5] and [24] when there is an amplitude limit, error probability decays only
exponentially with block length. More importantly if the power constraint restricts the energy spent in transmission
of each message for all noise realizations, i.e. if the power constraint is an almost sure power constraint3 of the form
Sn ≤ Pn; then sphere packing exponent is still an upper bound to the error exponent for AWGNCs as shown by
Pinsker, [26]. Furthermore if the feedback link is also an AWGNC and if there is a power constraint4 on the feedback
transmissions, then even in the case when there are only two messages, error probability decays only exponentially
as it has been recently shown by Kim et.al. [19].
The second channel model is the DMC model. Although feedback can not increase the error exponent for rates
over the critical rate, it can simplify the encoding scheme [35], [13]. Furthermore, for rates below the critical rate
it is possible to improve the error exponent using feedback. Zigangirov [35] has established lower bounds to the
error exponent for BSCs using a simple encoding scheme. Zigangirov’s lower bound is equal to the sphere packing
′
′
exponent for all rates in the interval [Rcrit , C] where Rcrit < Rcrit and Zigangirov’s lower bound is strictly larger than
′
the corresponding non-feedback exponent for rates below Rcrit . Later Burnashev [6] introduced an improvement to
′
Zigangirov’s bound for all positive rates less than Rcrit . D’yachkov [13] generalized Zigangirov’s encoding scheme
for general DMCs and established a lower bound to the error exponent for general binary input channels and k-ary
symmetric channels. However it is still an open problem to find a constructive technique that can be used for all
DMCs which outperforms the random coding bound. Like AWGNCs there has been a revived interest in the effect of
a noisy feedback link and achievable performances with noisy feedback on DMCs. Burnashev and Yamamoto recently
showed that error exponent of BSC channel increases even with a noisy feedback link [7], [8]. Furthermore Draper
and Sahai [12] investigated the use of noisy feedback link in variable length schemes.

The input and output alphabets of the forward channel are X and Y , respectively. The channel input and output
symbols at time t will be denoted by Xt and Yt respectively. Furthermore, the sequences of input and output symbols
from time t1 to time t2 are denoted by Xtt21 and Ytt12 . When t1 = 1 we omit t1 and simply write Xt2 and Yt2 instead
of Xt12 and Y1t2 . The forward channel is a stationary memoryless channel characterized by an |X |-by-|Y| transition
probability matrix W .

(1)

The feedback channel is noiseless and delay free i.e. the input of the feedback channel Zt−1 , chosen at the receiver,
is observed at the transmitter before transmission of Xt . In addition we assume that feedback channel is of infinite
capacity thus Zt−1 includes all of the observation of the receiver at time t − 1, i.e.5 Zt−1 = (Yt−1 , At−1 ). The random
variables A0 , A1 , . . . , An are there to enable randomized encoding and decoding schemes as we will see shortly. It is
assumed that the choice A’s does not affect the forward channels behavior, i.e. in addition to (1) we have6

The message M is drawn from the message set M with a uniform probability distribution and is given to the transmitter
at time zero. At each time t ∈ [1, n] the input symbol X t (M, Zt−1 ) is sent. The sequence of functions Xt (·) : M×Z t−1

which assigns an input symbol for each m ∈ M and z t−1 ∈ Z t−1 is called the encoding function. Note that the
random variables A0 , A1 , . . . , An−1 enable randomized encoding schemes. After receiving Yn the receiver draws the
final A, i.e. An , and decodes to the message M̂(Zn ) ∈ {x} ∪ M where x is the erasure symbol. The random variable
An does not have any effect on the encoding; it is used only to enable randomized decoding schemes.
The conditional error and erasure probabilities Pe|M and Px|M and unconditional error and erasure probabilities,
Pe and Px are defined as,

We use a somewhat abstract but rigorous approach in defining the rate and achievable exponent pairs. A reliable
sequence Q, is a sequence of codes indexed by their block lengths such that

|M(n) | )

= 0.

In other words reliable sequences are sequences of codes whose overall error probability, detected and undetected,
vanishes and whose size of message set grows to infinity with block length n.

Haroutunian, [17, Theorem 2], has already established a strong converse for erasure free block codes with feedback
which in our setting implies that limn→∞ (Pe (n) + Px (n) ) = 1 for all codes whose rates are strictly above the capacity,
i.e. R > C . Thus we consider only rates that are less than or equal to the capacity, R ≤ C . For all rates R below
capacity and for all non-negative erasure exponents Ex , we define the (true) error exponent Ee (R, Ex ) of fixed length
block codes with feedback to be the best error exponent of the reliable sequences7 whose rate is at least R and whose
erasure exponent is at least Ex .
Definition 2: ∀R ≤ C and ∀Ex ≥ 0 the error exponent, Ee (R, Ex ) is,

Note that
Ee (R, Ex ) = E(R)

∀Ex > E(R)

(4)

where E(R) is the (true) error exponent of erasure-free block codes on DMCs with feedback.8 Thus benefit of the
errors-and-erasures decoding is the possible increase in the error exponent as the erasure exponent goes below E(R).
Determining E(R) for all R’s and for all channels is still an open problem; only upper and lower bounds to E(R)
are known. Our investigation focuses on quantifying the gains of errors-and-erasures decoding instead of finding E(R).
Consequently, we restrict ourselves to the region where the erasure exponent is lower than the error exponent for the
encoding scheme.
For future reference let us recall the expressions for the random coding exponent and the sphere packing exponent,
Er (R, P ) = min D ( V k W |P ) + |I (P, V ) − R|+

We restrict ourselves to the reliable sequences in order to ensure finite error exponent at zero erasure exponent. Note that a decoder which
always declares erasures has zero erasure exponent and infinite error exponent.

and RQ′ = RQ . This together with the definition of E (R) leads to equation (4).

III. A N ACHIEVABLE E RROR E XPONENT - E RASURE E XPONENT T RADE O FF
In this section we establish a lower bound to the achievable error exponent as a function of erasure exponent
and rate. We use a two phase encoding scheme similar to the one described by Yamamoto and Ito in [34] together
with a decoding rule similar to the one described by Telatar in [32]. In the first phase, the transmitter uses a fixedcomposition code of length αn and rate R
α . At the end of the first phase, the receiver makes a maximum mutual
information decoding to obtain a tentative decision M̃. The transmitter knows M̃ because of the feedback link. In the
remaining (n − n1 ) time units, i.e. the second phase, the transmitter confirms the tentative decision by sending the
accept codeword, if M̃ = M, and rejects it by sending the reject codeword otherwise. At the end of the second phase
the receiver either declares an erasure or declares the tentative decision as the decoded message. Receiver declares the
tentative decision as the decoded message only when the tentative decision “dominates” all other messages. The word
“dominate” will be made precise later in Section III-B. Our scheme is inspired by [34] and [32]. However, unlike [34]
our decoding rule makes use of outputs of both of the phases instead of output of just second phase while deciding
between declaring an erasure or declaring the tentative decision as the final one, and unlike [32] our encoding scheme
is a feedback encoding scheme with two phases.
In the rest of this section, we analyze the performance of this coding architecture and derive an achievable error
exponent expression in terms of a given rate R, erasure exponent Ex , time sharing constant α, communication phase
type P , control phase type (joint empirical type of the accept codeword and reject codeword) Π and domination rule
≻. Then we optimize over ≻, Π, P and α, to obtain an achievable error exponent expression as a function of rate R
and erasure exponent Ex .
A. Fixed-Composition Codes and The Packing Lemma
We start with a very brief overview of certain properties of types. Those readers who are not familiar with method
types can use [9] for a concise introduction or [10] for a thorough study. The empirical distribution of an x n ∈ X n
is called the type of x n and the empirical distribution of transitions from a x n ∈ X n to a y n ∈ Y n is called the
conditional type:9

∀ỹ ∈ Y, ∀x̃ s.t. Px n (x̃ ) > 0.

For any probability transition matrix W : suppPx n → Y we have10
n

t=1

W (yt |xt ) = e−n(D( Vyn |xn kW |Pxn )+H(Vyn |xn |Pxn ))

(9)

The set of all y n ’s with the same conditional type V with respect to x n is called the V -shell of x n and denoted by
TV (x n ):
TV (x n ) = {y n : Vy n |x n = V }.
(10)
Note that for any transition probability matrix from X to Y total probability of TV (x n ) has to be less than one. Thus
by assuming that transition probabilities are V and using equation (9) we can conclude that,
|TV (x n ) | ≤ eH(Vy n |x n |Px n )
9

(11)

Note that Px n corresponds to a distribution on X for all x n ∈ X n , where as Vy n |x n determines a channel from the support of Px n to Y.
Note that for any W : X → Y there is unique consistent W ′ : suppPx n → Y.

Codes whose codewords all have the same empirical distribution, Px n (m) = P ∀m ∈ M are called fixed-composition
codes. In Section III-D we will describe the error and erasure events
in terms of the intersections of V −shells of

different codewords. For doing that let us define F (n) V, V̂ , m as the intersection of V -shell of x n (m) and the
V̂ -shells of other codewords:

In the first phase, the communication phase, we use a length n1 = ⌈αn⌉ type P fixed-composition code with
⌊e
⌋ codewords which satisfies the property described in Lemma 1. At the end of the first phase the receiver
makes a tentative decision by choosing the codeword that has the maximum empirical mutual information with the
output sequence Yn1 . If there is a tie, i.e. if there are more than one codewords which have the maximum empirical
mutual information, the receiver chooses the codeword which has the lowest index.

In the remaining (n − n1 ) time units, the transmitter sends the accept codeword xnn1 +1 (a) if M̃ = M and sends the
reject codeword xnn1 +1 (r) otherwise.
Note that our encoding scheme uses the feedback link actively for the encoding neither within the first phase nor
within the second phase. It does not even change the codewords it uses for accepting or rejecting the tentative decision
depending on the observation in the first phase. Feedback is only used to reveal the tentative decision to the transmitter.
Accept and reject codewords have joint type Π(x̃ , x̃˜ ), i.e. the ratio of the number of time instances in which accept
codeword has an x̃ ∈ X and reject codeword has a x̃˜ ∈ X to the length of the codewords, (n − n1 ), is Π(x̃ , x̃˜ ). The
joint conditional type of the output sequence in the second phase, Uynn1 +1 , is the empirical conditional distribution of
ynn1 +1 . We call set of all output sequences ynn1 +1 whose joint conditional type is U , the U -shell and denote it by TU .
Like we did in the Corollary 1, we can upper bound the probability of U -shells. Note that if Ynn1 +1 ∈ TU then,

C. Decoding Rule

For an encoder like the one in Section III-B, a decoder that depends only on the conditional type of Yn1 for different
codewords in the communication phase, i.e. VYn1 |x n1 (m) ’s for m ∈ M, the conditional type of the channel output
in the control phase, i.e. UYnn1 +1 , and the indices of the codewords can achieve the minimum error probability for a
given erasure probability. However finding that decoder becomes analytically intractable. Instead, we restrict ourselves
to the decoders that can be written in terms of pair wise comparisons between messages given Yn . Furthermore we
assume that these pairwise comparisons depend only on the conditional type of Yn1 for the messages compared, the
conditional output type in the control phase and the indices of the messages. Thus if the triplet corresponding to the
tentative decision (VYn1 |x n1 (M̃) , UYnn1 +1 , M̃) dominates all other triplets of the form (VYn1 |x n1 (m) , UYnn1 +1 , m) for m 6= M̃,
the tentative decision becomes final; else an erasure is declared.11
)

M̃ if ∀m 6= M̃

(17)
M̂ =
x if ∃m 6= M̃ s.t. (VYn1 |M̃ , UYnn1 +1 , M̃) ⊁ (VYn1 |m , UYnn1 +1 , m)
The binary relation ≻ is such that if (V, U, m) dominates (V̂ , U, m̃) then (V̂ , U, m̃) does not dominate (V, U, m):
(V, U, m) ≻ (V̂ , U, m̃) ⇒ (V̂ , U, m̃) ⊁ (V, U, m).

This property is a necessary and sufficient condition for a binary relation to be a domination rule. Decoder given by
(17), however, either accepts or rejects the tentative decision M̃ given in (15). Consequently its domination rule also
satisfies following two properties:
(a) If the empirical mutual information of the messages in the communication phase are not equal, only the message
with larger mutual information can dominate the other one.
(b) If the empirical mutual information of the messages in the communication phase are equal, only the message with
lower index can dominate the other one.
For any such binary relation there is a corresponding decoder of the form given in equation (17). In our scheme we
either use the trivial domination rule leading to the trivial decoder M̂ = M̃ or the domination rule given in equation
(18), both of which satisfies these conditions.

Among the family of decoders we are considering, i.e. among the decoders that only depend on the pairwise
comparisons between conditional types and indices of the messages compared, the decoder given in (17) and (18) is
optimal in terms of error exponent erasure exponent trade off. Furthermore, in order to employ this decoding rule, the
receiver needs to determine only the two messages with the highest empirical mutual information in the first phase.
Then the receiver needs to check whether the triplet corresponding to the tentative decision dominates the triplet
corresponding to the message with the second highest empirical mutual information. If it does then, for the rule given
in (18), it is guaranteed to dominate the rest of the triplets too.
Note that conditional probability, P[Yn | M = m], is only a function of corresponding VYn1 |x n (m) and UYnn +1 . Thus all decoding rules, that

P[Yn |M=M̃]
accepts or rejects the tentative decision, M̃, based on a threshold test on likelihood ratios, P[Yn |M=m] , for m 6= M̃ are in this family of decoding
rules.

D. Error Analysis
Using an encoder like the one described in Section III-B and a decoder like the one in (17) we achieve the
performance given below. If Ex ≤ αEr ( R
α , P ) then the domination rule given in equation (18) is used in the decoder;
else a trivial domination rule that leads to a erasure-free decoding, M̂ = M̃, is used in the decoder.

The optimization problem given in (19) is a convex optimization problem: it is minimization of a convex function
over a convex set. Thus the value of the exponent, Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π) can numerically be calculated relatively easily.
Furthermore Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π) can be written in terms of solutions of lower dimensional optimization problems (see
equation (38). However problem of finding the optimal (α, P, Π) triple for a given (R, Ex ) pair is not that easy in
general, as we will discuss in more detail in Section III-E.
Note that for all control phase types Π and control phaseoutput types U , D ( U k Wa |Π) ≥ 0, D ( U k Wr |Π) ≥ 0.
Using this fact together with the definitions of Er (R, P ), η R, P, V̂ , V and Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π) given in (5), (14)
and (19) we get:
∀(R, Ex , α, P, Π) s.t. Ex ≤ αEr ( R
α,P)

Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π) ≥ αEr ( R
α,P)

(20)

Since we are interested in quantifying the gains of errors-and-erasures decoding over the decoding schemes without
erasures we are ultimately interested only in the region where Ex ≤ αEr ( R
α , P ) holds. However equation (19) gives
us the whole achievable region for the family of codes we are considering.
Proof: A decoder of the form given in (17) decodes correctly when M̃ = M and (Yn , M) ≻ (Yn , m) for all12
m 6= M. Thus an error or an erasure occur only when the correct message does not dominate all other messages, i.e.
when ∃m 6= M such that (Yn , M) ⊁ (Yn , m). Consequently, we can write the sum of conditional error and erasure
probabilities for a message m ∈ M as,
Pe|m + Px|m = P[{y n : ∃m̃ 6= m s.t.(y n , m) ⊁ (y n , m̃)}| M = m]

(21)

This can happen in two ways, either there is an error in the first phase, i.e. M̃ 6= m or first phase tentative decision
is correct, i.e. M̃ = m , but the second phase observation ynn1 +1 leads to an erasure i.e. M̂ = x. For a decoder using a
domination rule satisfying constraints described in Section III-C,

In addition the number of different non-empty V -shells in the communication phase is less than (n1 + 1)|X ||Y| and
2
the number of non-empty U -shells in the control phase is less than (n − n1 + 1)|X | |Y|. We denote the set of (V, V̂ , U )

In the above definition m is a dummy variable and Vx is the same set for all m ∈ M. Thus using (22) we get

On the other hand an error occurs only when an incorrect message dominates all other messages, i.e. when ∃m̃ 6= m

The tentative decision is not equal to m only if there is a message with a strictly higher empirical mutual information
or if there is a messages which has equal mutual information but smaller index. This is the reason why we sum over

Note that m in the definition of Ve is also a dummy variable. The domination rule ≻ divides the set V into two

E. Lower Bound to Ee (R, Ex ):

In this section we use Theorem 1 to derive a lower bound to the optimal error exponent Ee (R, Ex ). We do that by
optimizing the achievable performance Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π) over α, P and Π.
1) High Erasure Exponent Region (i.e. Ex > Er (R)): As a result of (19), ∀R ≥ 0 and ∀Ex > Er (R)
Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π) = αEr ( R
α , P ) ≤ Er (R)

Ee (R, Ex , α̃, P̃ , Π) = Er (R)

∀α ∈ [0, 1],

∀P,

α̃ = 1,

P̃ = arg max Er (R, P ),
P

∀Π

∀Π.

(27a)
(27b)

Thus for all (R, Ex ) pairs such that Ex > Er (R): optimal time sharing constant is 1, optimal input distribution is
the optimal input distribution for random coding exponent at rate R, we use maximum mutual information decoding
and never declare erasures. Furthermore since α = 1 we have only a single phase in our scheme.
Ee (R, Ex ) = Ee (R, Ex , 1, Pr(R) , Π) = Er (R)

∀R ≥ 0

∀Ex > Er (R)

(28)

where Pr(R) satisfies Er (R, Pr(R) ) = Er (R) and Π can be any control phase type. Evidently benefits of errors-anderasures decoding is not observed in this region.
2) Low Erasure Exponent Region (i.e. Ex ≤ Er (R)): We observe and quantify the benefits of errors-and-erasures
decoding for (R, Ex ) pairs such that Ex ≤ Er (R). Since Er (R) is a non-negative non-increasing and convex function
of R, we have
α ∈ [α∗ (R, Ex ), 1] ⇔ Ex ≤ αEr ( R
∀R ≥ 0
∀0 < Ex ≤ Er (R)
α)
where α∗ (R, Ex ) is the unique solution of the equation αEr ( R
α ) = Ex .
R
For the case Ex = 0, however, αEr ( α ) = 0 has multiple solutions and Theorem 1 holds but resulting error
exponent, Ee (R, 0, α, P, Π), does not correspond to the error exponent of a reliable sequence. Convention introduced
below in equation (29) addresses both issues at once, by choosing the minimum of those solutions as α∗ (R, 0). In
addition by this convention α∗ (R, Ex ) is also continuous at Ex = 0: limEx →0 α∗ (R, Ex ) = α∗ (R, 0).

where g−1 (·) is the inverse of the function g(r) = Err(r) .
As a result equations (19) and (29), ∀R ≥ 0 and ∀0 < Ex ≤ Er (R) we have
Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π) = αEr ( R
α , P ) ≤ Er (R)

Ee (R, Ex , α̃, P̃ , Π) = Er (R)

α̃ = 1,

P̃ = arg max Er (R, P ),

∀Π

∀Π.

(30a)
(30b)

Thus for all (R, Ex ) pairs such that Ex ≤ Er (R) optimal time sharing constant is in the interval [α∗ (R, Ex ), 1].
For an (R, Ex , α) triple such that R ≥ 0, Ex ≤ Er (R) and α ∈ [α∗ (R, Ex ), 1] let P (R, Ex , α) be
P (R, Ex , α) , {P : αEr ( R
α , P ) ≥ Ex , I (P, W ) ≥

(31)

The constraint on mutual information is there to ensure that Ee (R, 0, α, P, Π)’s are corresponding to error exponent
of reliable sequences. The set P (R, Ex , α) is convex because Er (R, P ) and I (P, W ) are concave in P .
Note that ∀R ≥ 0 and ∀Ex ∈ (0, Er (R)],
∀α ∈ [α∗ (R, Ex ), 1],

Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π) = αEr ( R

(32b)

As a result of (32) we can restrict the optimization over P to P (R, Ex , α) when R ≥ 0 and Ex ∈ (0, Er (R)]. For
Ex = 0 case if we require the expression Ee (R, 0, α, P, Π) to correspond to the error exponent of a reliable sequence,
we get the restriction given in equation (32). Thus using Theorem 1 we conclude that Ee (R, Ex ) given below is an
achievable error exponent at rate R and erasure exponent Ex .
Ee (R, Ex ) =

∀Ex ≤ Er (R)

(33)

where α∗ (R, Ex ), P (R, Ex , α) and Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π) are given in equations (29), (31) and (19).
Note that unlike Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π) itself, Ee (R, Ex ) as defined in (33) corresponds to error exponent of reliable
code sequences even at Ex = 0.
If the maximizing P for the inner maximization in equation (33) is same for all α ∈ [α∗ (R, Ex ), 1], the optimal
value of α is α∗ (R, Ex ). In order to see that, we first observe that any fixed (R, Ex , P, Π) such that Er (R, P ) ≥ Ex ,
function Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π) is convex in α for all α ∈ [α∗ (R, Ex , P ), 1] where α∗ (R, Ex , P ) is the unique solution
of the equation14 αEr ( R
α , P ) = Ex as it is shown Lemma 10 in Appendix B. Since the maximization preserves the
convexity, maxΠ Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π) is also convex in α for all α ∈ [α∗ (R, Ex , P ), 1]. Thus for any (R, Ex , P ) triple,
maxΠ Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π), takes its maximum value either at the minimum possible value of α, i.e. α∗ (R, Ex , P ) =
α∗ (R, Ex ), or at the maximum possible value of α, i.e. 1. It is shown in Appendix C maxΠ Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π) takes
its maximum value at α = α∗ (R, Ex ).
Furthermore if the maximizing P is not only the same for all α ∈ [α∗ (R, Ex ), 1] for a given (R, Ex ) pair but also
for all (R, Ex ) pairs such that Ex ≤ Er (R) then we can find the optimal Ee (R, Ex ) by simply maximizing over Π’s.
In symmetric channels, for example, uniform distribution is the optimal distribution for all (R, Ex ) pairs. Thus


Ee (R, Ex , 1, P ∗ , Π)

(34)
Ee (R, Ex ) =
maxΠ Ee (R, Ex , α∗ (R, Ex ), P ∗ , Π) if Ex ≤ Er (R, P ∗ )
where P ∗ is the uniform distribution.

F. Alternative Expression for Exponent:
The minimization given in (19) for Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π) is over transition probability matrices and control phase
output types. In order to get a better grasp of the resulting expression, we simplify the analytical expression in this
section. We do that by expressing the minimization in (19) in terms of solutions of lower dimensional optimization
problems.
Let ζ(R, P, Q) be the minimum Kullback-Leibler divergence under P with respect to W among the transition
probability matrices whose mutual information under P is less than R and whose output distribution under P is Q.
It is shown in Appendix B that for a given P , ζ(R, P, Q) is convex in (R, Q) pair. Evidently for a given (P, Q) pair
ζ(R, P, Q) is a non-increasing in R. Thus for a given (P, Q) pair ζ(R, P, Q) is strictly decreasing on a closed interval
and is an extended real valued function of the form:

G. Special Cases
1) Zero Erasure Exponent Case, Ee (R, 0): Using a simple repetition-at-erasures scheme, fixed length errors-anderasures codes, can be converted into variable length block codes, with the same error exponent. Thus the error
exponents of variable length block codes given by Burnashev in [3] is an upper bound to the error exponent of fixed
length block codes with erasures:

Thus for any (R, 0, α, P ) such that P ∈ P (R, 0, α), R′′ ≥ R′ ≥ R, T ≥ 0 and αEsp ( Rα , P ) + R′ − R + T ≤ 0,
imply that R′ = R, R′′ = αI (P, W ), T = 0. Consequently

Indeed one need not to rely on the converse on variable length block codes in order to establish the fact that

particular optimality result but also upper bounds the optimal error exponent, Ee (R, Ex ), as a function of rate R and
erasure exponents Ex .
2) Channels with non-zero Zero Error Capacity: For channels with a non-zero zero-error capacity, as a result of
equation (19) Ee (R, Ex ) = ∞ for any Ex < Er (R). This implies that we can get error-free block codes with this
two phase coding scheme for any rate R < C and any erasure exponent Ex ≤ Er (R). As we discuss in Section V in
more detail, this is the best erasure exponent for rates over the critical rate, at least for symmetric channels.

In this section we derive an upper bound on Ee (R, Ex ) using previously known results on erasure free block codes
with feedback and a generalization of the straight line bound of Shannon, Gallager and Berlekamp [31]. We first
present a lower bound on the minimum error probability of block codes with feedback and erasures, in terms of that
of shorter codes in Section IV-A. Then in Section IV-B we make a brief overview of the outer bounds on the error
exponents of erasure free block codes with feedback. Finally in Section IV-C, we use the relation we have derived in
Section IV-A to tie the previously known results we have summarized in Section IV-B to bound Ee (R, Ex ).
A. A Trait of Minimum Error Probability of block codes with Erasures
Shannon, Gallager and Berlekamp in [31] considered fixed length block codes, with list decoding and established
a family of lower bounds on the minimum error probability in terms of the product of minimum error probabilities
of certain shorter codes. They have shown, [31, Theorem 1], that for fixed length block codes with list decoding and
without feedback
P˜e (M, n, L) ≥ P˜e (M, n1 , L1 )P˜e (L1 + 1, n − n1 , L)
(46)

where P˜e (M, n, L) denotes the minimum error probability of erasure free block codes of length n with M equally
probable messages and with decoding list size L. As they have already pointed out in [31] this theorem continues to
hold in the case when a feedback link is available from receiver to the transmitter; although P˜e ’s are different when
feedback is available, the relation given in equation (46) still holds. They were interested in erasure free codes. We,
on the other hand, are interested in block codes which might have non-zero erasure probability. Accordingly we need
to incorporate erasure probability as one of the parameters of the optimal error probability. This is what this section
is dedicated to.
In a size L list decoder with erasures, decoded set M̂ is either a subset15 of M whose size is at most L, like the
erasure-free case, or a set which only includes the erasure symbol, i.e. either M̂ ⊂ M such that |M̂| ≤ L or M̂ = {x}.
An erasure occurs whenever M̂ = {x} and an error occurs whenever M̂ 6= {x} and M ∈
/ M̂. We will denote the
minimum error probability of length n block codes, with M equally probable messages, decoding list size L and
erasure probability Px by Pe (M, n, L, Px ).
Theorem 2 below bounds the error probability of block codes with erasures and list decoding using the error
probabilities of shorter codes with erasures and list decoding, like [31, Theorem 1] does in the erasure free case. Like
its counter part in erasure free case Theorem 2 is later used to establish outer bounds to error exponents.
Theorem 2: For any n, M , L, Px , n1 ≤ n, L1 , and 0 ≤ s ≤ 1 the minimum error probability of fixed length block
codes with feedback satisfy

Note that given a (M, n, L) triple if the error probability erasure probability pairs (Pe1 , Px1 ) and (Pe2 , Px2 ) are
achievable, then for any γ ∈ [0, 1] using the initial symbol A0 of the feedback link we can construct a code that uses
the code achieving (Pe1 , Px1 ) with probability γ , the code achieving (Pe2 , Px2 ) with probability (1 − γ ). This new
code achieves error probability erasure probability pair (γPea + (1 − γ)Peb , γPxa + (1 − γ)Pxb ). As a result for any
(M, n, L) triple the set of achievable error probability erasure probability pairs is convex. We use this fact twice in
order to prove Theorem 2.
Let us first consider the following lemma which bounds the achievable error probability erasure probability, pairs
for block codes with nonuniform a priori probability distribution, in terms of block codes with a uniform a priori
probability distribution but fewer messages.
Lemma 2: For any length n block code with message set M, a priori probability distribution ϕ(·) on M, erasure

Recall that Pe (K + 1, n, L, Px ) is the minimum error probability of length n codes with (K + 1) equally probable
messages and decoding list size L, with feedback if the original code does have feedback and without feedback if the
original code does not.
Note that Ω (ϕ, K) is the error probability of a decoder which decodes to the set of K most likely messages under
ϕ. In other words Ω (ϕ, K) is the minimum error probability for a size K list decoder when the posterior probability
distribution is ϕ.
Proof: If Ω (ϕ, K) = 0, the lemma holds trivially. Thus we assume Ω (ϕ, K) > 0 henceforth. For any size
(K + 1) subset M′ of M, one can use the encoding scheme and the decoding rule of the original code for M, to
construct the following block code for M′ :
• Encoder:∀m ∈ M′ use the encoding scheme for message m in the original code, i.e.
Xt′ (m, z t−1 ) = Xt (m, z t−1 )

•

∀m ∈ M′ , t ∈ [1, n], z t−1 ∈ Z t−1

Decoder: For all z n ∈ Z n if the original decoding rule declares erasure, declare erasure, else the decode to the
intersection of the original decoded list and M′ .

This is a length n code with (K + 1) messages and decoding list size L. Furthermore for all m in M′ the conditional

error probability Pe|m
and the conditional erasure probability Px|m
are equal to the conditional error probability Pe|m
and the conditional erasure probability Px|m in the original code, respectively.

where Ψ(K + 1, n, L) is the set of achievable error probability, erasure probability pairs for length n block codes with

Let the smallest non-zero element of {ϕ(1), ϕ(2), . . . ϕ(|M|)} be ϕ(ξ1 ). For any size (K + 1) subset of M which
includes ξ1 and all whose elements have non-zero probabilities, say M1 , we have,

Equation (49) and the definition of Ψ(K + 1, n, L), implies that ∃ψ1 ∈ Ψ(K + 1, n, L) such that

where ϕ(ψ1 ) = (K + 1)ϕ(ξ1 ) and ϕ(1) (m) = ϕ(m) − ϕ(ξ1 )1{m∈M1 } . Furthermore the number of non-zero ϕ(1) (m)’s
is at least one less than that of non-zero ϕ(m)’s. The remaining probabilities, ϕ(1) (m), have a minimum, ϕ(1) (ξ2 )
among its non-zero elements. One can repeat the same argument once more using that element and reduce the number
of non-zero elements at least one more. After at most |M| − K such iterations one reaches to a ϕ(ℓ) which is non-zero
for K or fewer messages:

where ϕ(ℓ) (m) ≤ ϕ(m) for all m in M and m∈M 1{ϕ(ℓ) (m)>0} ≤ K .

In equation (52), the first sum is equal to a convex combination of ψj ’s multiplied by ℓj=1 ϕ(ψj ); the second sum
is equal to a pair with non-negative entries. As a result of definition of Ω (ϕ, K) given in equation (48),
Xℓ
Ω (ϕ, K) ≤
ϕ(ψj ).

Then as a result of convexity of Ψ(K + 1, n, L) we can conclude that there exists a ψ ∈ Ψ(K + 1, n, L) such that
(Pe , Px ) = aΩ (ϕ, K) ψ̃ + (b1 , b2 ) for some a ≥ 1, b1 ≥ 0 and b2 ≥ 0. Thus

∃ψ ∈ Ψ(K + 1, n, L) such that ( Ω(ϕ,K)

(54)

Then the lemma follows from equation (54), the fact that Pe (M, n, L, Px ) is decreasing in Px and the fact that
Pe (M, n, L, Px ) is uniquely determined by Ψ(M, n, L) for sx ∈ [0, 1] as follows
Pe (M, n, L, Px ) =

For proving Theorem 2, we express the error and erasure probabilities, as a convex combination of error and erasure
probabilities of (n−n1 ) long block codes with a priori probability distribution ϕz n1 (m) = P[m| z n1 ] over the messages
and apply Lemma 2 together with convexity arguments similar to the ones above.
Proof [Theorem 2]:
For all m in M, let Υ(m) be the decoding region of m , Υ(x) be the decoding region of the erasure symbol x and
Υ̃(m) the error region of m :

where the second inequality follows from the convexity of Pe (M, n, L, Px ) in Px . Note that Pe (M, n, L, Px ) is
convex in Px because of the equation (55) and the convexity of the region Ψ(M, n, L).
Now consider a code which uses the first n1 time units of the original encoding scheme as its encoding scheme.
Decoder of this new code draws a real number from [0, 1] uniformly at random, independently of Zn1 of the original
code (and the message evidently). If this number is less than s it declares erasure else it makes a maximum
likelihood decoding with list of size L1 . Then the sum on the left hand side of the below expression (60) is its error
probability. But that probability is lower bounded by Pe (M, n1 , L1 , s) which is minimum error probability over all
length n1 block codes with M messages and decoding list size L1 , i.e.
X
P[z n1 ] (1 − s)Ω (ϕz n1 , L1 ) ≥ Pe (M, n1 , L1 , s) .

Then the theorem follows from the fact that Pe (M, n, L1 , Px ) is decreasing function of Px and the equations (59)
and (60).
QED
Like the result of Shannon, Gallager and Berlekamp in [31, Theorem 1], Theorem 2 is correct both with and without
feedback. Although Pe ’s are different in each case, the relationship between them given in equation (47) holds in
both cases.
B. Classical Results on Error Exponent of Erasure-free Block Codes with Feedback:

In this section we give a very brief overview of the previously known results on the error probability of erasure
free block codes with feedback. These result are used in Section IV-C together with Theorem 2 to bound Ee (R, Ex )
from above. Note that Theorem 2 only relates the error probability of longer codes to that of the shorter ones. It does
not in and of itself bound the error probability. It is in a sense a tool to glue together various bounds on the error
probability.
First bound we consider is on the error exponent of erasure free block codes with feedback. Haroutunian proved
in [17] that, for any (Mn , n, Ln ) sequence of triples, such that limn→∞ ln Mn n−ln Ln = R,
lim

n→∞

where
EH (R) =

min

V :C(V )≤R

max D ( V k W |P )

and

P

C(V ) = max I (P, V ) .
P

(62)

Second bound we consider is on the trade off between the error exponents of two messages in a two message
erasure free block code with feedback. Berlekamp mentions this result in passing in [1] and attributes it to Gallager
and Shannon.
Lemma 3: For any feedback encoding scheme with two messages and erasure free decision rule and for all T ≥ T0 :
either

(65)

Result is old and somewhat intuitive to those who are familiar with the calculations in the non-feedback case. Thus
probably it has been proven a number of times. But we are not aware of a published proof, hence we have included
one in Appendix A.
17

Although Lemma 3 establishes only the converse part (T, Γ (T )) is indeed the optimal trade off for the error
exponents of two messages in an erasure free block code, both with and without feedback. Achievablity of this
trade off has already been established in [31, Theorem 5] for the case without feedback; evidently this implies the
achievablity with feedback. Furthermore T0 does have an operational meaning, it is the maximum error exponent first
message can have, while the second message has zero error probability. This fact is also proved in Appendix A.
For some channels Lemma 3 gives us a bound on the error exponent of erasure free-codes at zero rate, which is
tighter than Haroutunian’s bound at zero rate. In order to see this let us first define T ∗ to be
T ∗ = max min{T, Γ (T )}.

(66)

T

P
Note that T ∗ is finite iff y W (y|x )W (y|x̃ ) > 0 for all x , x̃ pairs. Recall that this is also the necessary and sufficient
condition of zero-error capacity, C0 , to be zero. EH (R) on the other hand is infinite for all R ≤ R∞ like Esp (R)
where R∞ is given by,

Even in the cases where EH (0) is finite, EH (0) ≥
We can use this fact, Lemma 3, and Theorem 2, or [31,
Theorem 1] for that matter, to strengthen Haroutunian bound at low rates, as follows.

and Rht is the unique solution of the equation T ∗ = EH (R) − REH
ht
Before going into the proof let us note that ẼH (R) is obtained simply by drawing the tangent line to the curve
(R, EH (R)) from the point (0, T ∗ ). The curve (R, ẼH (R)) is same as the tangent line, for the rates between 0 and
Rht , and it is same as the curve (R, EH (R)) from then on where Rht is the rate of the point at which the tangent
from (0, T ∗ ) meets the curve (R, EH (R)).
Proof: For R ≥ Rht this Lemma immediately follows from Haroutunian’s result in [17] for L1 = 1. If R < Rht
then we apply Theorem 2.

C. Generalized Straight Line Bound for Error-Erasure Exponents
Theorem 2 bounds the minimum error probability length n block codes from below in terms of the minimum error
probability of length n1 and length (n−n1 ) block codes. The rate and erasure probability of the longer code constraints
the rates and erasure probabilities of the shorter ones, but does not specify them completely. We use this fact together
with the improved Haroutunian’s bound on the error exponents of erasure free block codes with feedback, i.e. Lemma
4, and the error exponent trade off of the erasure free feedback block codes with two messages, i.e. Lemma 3, to
obtain a family of upper bounds on the error exponents of feedback block codes with erasure.

Theorem 3 simply states that any line connecting any two points of the curves (R, Ex , Ee ) = (R, ẼH (R), ẼH (R))
and (R, Ex , Ee ) = (0, Ex , Γ (Ex )) lies above the surface (R, Ex , Ee ) = (R, Ex , Ee (R, Ex )). The condition C0 = 0
is not merely a technical condition due to the proof technique; as we will see in Section V for channels with C0 > 0,
there are zero-error codes with erasure exponent as high as Esp (R) for any rate R ≤ C .
Proof: We will consider the cases r ∈ (rh (R, Ex ), C] and r = rh (R, Ex ) separately.

(76)

Note that, Theorem 3 for r = rh (R, Ex ) case is equivalent to (76). Identity given in (75) follows from an analysis
similar to the one used for establishing (72), in which but instead of Lemma 3, we use a simple typicality argument
like [10, Corollary 1.2].
We have set L1 = 1 in the proof. If instead of L1 = 1 we had chosen L1 to be a subexponential function of n
which grew to infinity with n, the logic and the mechanics of the proof would still work but we would have replaced
Γ (T ) with Ee (0, Ex ), while keeping the term including ẼH (R) the same. Since the best known upper bound for
Ee (0, Ex ) is Γ (Ex ) for Ex ≤ T ∗ final result is same for case with feedback.18 On the other hand for the case without
feedback, which is not the main focus of this paper, this does make a difference. By choosing L1 to be a function
of block length that goes to infinity subexponentially with block length one can use Telatar’s converse result [32,
Theorem 4.4] on the error exponent at zero rate and zero erasure exponent without feedback.
In Figure 1, the upper and lower bounds we have derived for error exponent are plotted as a function of erasure
exponent for a binary symmetric channel with cross over probability ǫ = 0.25 at rate R = 8.62 × 10−2 nats per
channel use. Solid lines are lower bounds to the error exponent for block codes with feedback, which have been
established in Section III, and without feedback, which was established previously, [14], [10], [32]. Dashed lines are
the upper bounds obtained using Theorem 3.
Note that all four curves meet at a point on bottom right, this is the point that corresponds to the error exponent
of block codes at rate R = 8.62 × 10−2 nats per channel use and its values are the same with and without feedback
since we are on a symmetric channel and our rate is over the critical rate. Any point to the lower right of this point
is achievable both with and without feedback.
The proximity of the inner and the outer bound demonstrated in Figure 1 is not particular to the channel we have
chosen. A discussion of the closeness of the inner and outer bounds are given in Section VI.
18
In binary symmetric channels these result can be strengthened using the value of E (0), [36]. However those changes will improve the upper
bound on error exponent only at low rates and high erasure exponents.

E RROR -F REE C ODES :Ex (R)

For all DMCs which have one or more zero probability transitions, for all rates below capacity, R ≤ C and for
small enough Ex ’s, Ee (R, Ex ) = ∞. For such (R, Ex ) pairs, coding scheme we have described in Section III gives
us an error free code. The connection between the erasure exponent of error free block codes, and error exponent of
block codes with erasures is not confined to this particular encoding scheme. In order to explain those connections
in more detail let us first define the error-free codes more formally.
Definition 3: A sequences Q0 of block codes with feedback is an error-free reliable sequence iff
Pe (n) = 0

∀n,

lim supn→∞ (Px (n) +

and

|M(n) | )

= 0.

The highest rate achievable for error-free reliable codes is the zero-error capacity with feedback and erasures, Cx,0 .

for all m, m̃ ∈ M
If all the transition probabilities are positive i.e. minx ,y W (y|x ) = δ > 0, then P[z

and z n ∈ Z n . Thus we have

Consequently we have Pe ≥ (enR (e

the encoding scheme suggested by Yamamoto and Itoh in [34], if there is one or more zero probability transitions,
Cx,0 is equal to channel capacity C .
Definition 4: For all DMCs with at least one (x , y) pair such that W (y|x ) = 0, ∀R ≤ C erasure exponent of error
free block codes with feedback is defined as

Ex (R) ,

Ex (Q0 ).

Q0 :R(Q0 )≥R

For any erasure exponent, Ex less than Ex (R), there is an error-free reliable sequence, i.e. there is a reliable sequence
with infinite error exponent:
Ex ≤ Ex (R) ⇒ Ee (R, Ex ) = ∞.
(79)
21

More interestingly if Ex > Ex (R) then Ee (R, Ex ) < ∞. In order to see this let δ be the minimum non-zero transition

(80)

Equation (80) reveals that the total probability of z n ’s at which receiver chooses to decode to a message rather than
declaring an erasure despite the fact that it is not certain about the message is upper bounded by (1 + δ−n ) times the
undetected error probability. Thus if we replace the decoder with a new decoder which declares an erasure unless it
is sure about the transmitted message, i.e. unless there is a message with posterior probability one, resulting erasure
probability Px ′ will be bounded in terms of original error and erasure probabilities as follows,
Px ′ ≤ Px + (1 + δ−n )Pe .

(81)

Thus by changing the decoding rule, any length n code with error probability Pe and erasure probability Px can
be transformed into error free code with erasure probability Px ′ , where Px ′ satisfies equation (81). Using this
transformation we can change any code with errors-and-erasure decoding into a error free block code with erasures.
Evidently we can use the very same transformation to convert reliable sequences into error-free reliable sequences.
Considering error and erasure exponents of the original reliable sequences and erasure exponents of resulting error
free reliable sequences we get,
Ex (R) ≥ min{Ex , Ee (R, Ex ) + ln δ}

∀R, Ex .

(82)

Ex > Ex (R) ⇒ Ee (R, Ex ) ≤ Ex (R) − ln δ < ∞.

(83)

Consequently,
As a result of equations (79) and (83) we can conclude that Ee (R, Ex ) = ∞ if and only if Ex ≤ Ex (R). In a sense
like the error exponent of erasure free block codes, E(R), erasure exponent of the error free bock codes, Ex (R),
gives a partial description of E(R, Ex ). E(R) gives the value of error exponents below which erasure exponent can
be pushed to infinity and Ex (R) gives the value of erasure exponent below which error exponent can be pushed to
infinity.
Below the erasure exponent of zero-error codes, Ex (R), is investigated separately for two families of channels:
Channels which have a positive zero error capacity, i.e. C0 > 0 and Channels which have zero zero-error capacity,
i.e. C0 = 0.
A. Case 1: C0 > 0

Theorem 4: For a DMC if C0 > 0 then,
EH (R) ≥ Ex (R) ≥ Esp (R).

Proof: If zero-error capacity is strictly greater then zero, i.e. C0 > 0, then one can achieve the sphere packing
exponent, with zero error probability using a two phase scheme. In
first phase transmitter uses a length n1 = ⌈en1 R ⌉
 the
∂
block code without feedback with a list decoder of size L = ∂R Esp (R, PR∗ ) where PR∗ is the input distribution
satisfying Esp (R) = Esp (R, PR∗ ). Note that with this list size the sphere packing exponent19 is achievable at rate R.
Thus correct message is in the list with at least probability (1 − e−n1 Esp (R) ), see [10, Page 196]. In the second phase
transmitter uses a zero error code, of length20 n2 = ⌈ ln(L+1)
⌉ with L + 1 messages, to tell the receiver whether the
C0
correct message is in that list or not, and the correct message itself if it is in the list. Clearly such a feedback code
with two phases is error free, and it has erasures only when there exists an error in the first phase. Thus the erasure
probability of the over all code is upper bounded by e−n1 Esp (R) . Note that n2 is fixed for a given R. Consequently as
19

Indeed this upper bound on error probability is tight exponentially for block codes without feedback.
⌉ time units to convey one of the (L + 1) messages
For some DMCs with C0 > 0 and for some L one may need more than ⌈ ln(L+1)
C0
without any errors, because C0 itself is defined as a limit. But even in those cases we are guaranteed to have a fixed amount of time for that
transmissions, which does not change with n1 . Thus above argument holds as is even in those cases.
20

22

the length of the first phase, n1 , grows to infinity the rate and erasure exponent of (n1 + n2 ) long block code converges
to the rate and error exponent of n1 long code of the first phase, i.e. to R and Esp (R). Thus
Ex (R) ≥ Esp (R).

Any error free block code with erasures can be forced to decode, at erasures. The resulting fixed length code has
an error probability no larger than the erasure probability of the original code. However we know that, [17], error
probability of the erasure free block codes with feedback decreases with an exponent no larger than EH (R). Thus,
Ex (R) ≤ EH (R).

This upper bound on the erasure exponent also follows from the converse result we present in the next section,
Theorem 6.
For symmetric channels EH (R) = Esp (R) and Theorem 4 determines the erasure exponent of error-free codes on
symmetric channels with non-zero zero-error-capacity completely.
B. Case 2: C0 = 0

This case is more involved than the previous one. We first establish an upper bound on Ex (R) in terms of the
improved version of Haroutunian’s bound, i.e. Lemma 4, and the erasure exponent of error-free codes at zero rate,
Ex (0). Then we show that Ex (0) is equal to the erasure exponent error-free block codes with two messages, Ex,2 , and
bound Ex,2 from below.
For any M , n and L, Pe (M, n, L, Px ) = 0 for large enough Px . We denote the minimum of such Px ’s by
P0,x (M, n, L). Thus we can write Ex,2 as
Ex,2 = lim inf P0,x (2, n, 1) .
n→∞

Theorem 5: For any n, M , L, n1 ≤ n and L1 , minimum erasure probability of fixed length error-free block codes
with feedback, P0,x (M, n, L), satisfies
P0,x (M, n, L) ≥ Pe (M, n1 , L1 , 0)P0,x (L1 + 1, n − n1 , L) .

(84)

Like Theorem 2, Theorem 5 is correct both with and without feedback. Although P0,x ’s and Pe will be different in
each case, the relationship between them given in equation (84) holds in both cases.
Proof: If Pe (M, n1 , L1 , 0) = 0 theorem holds trivially. Thus we assume henceforth that Pe (M, n1 , L1 , 0) > 0.
Using Theorem 2 with Px = P0,x (M, n, L) we get


0,x (M,n,L)
Pe (M, n, L, P0,x (M, n, L)) ≥ Pe (M, n1 , L1 , 0)Pe L1 + 1, (n − n1 ), L, PPe (M,n

Since Pe (M, n, L, P0,x (M, n, L)) = 0 and Pe (M, n1 , L1 , 0) > 0 we have,

Pe L1 + 1, (n − n1 ), L, PPe 0,x

Thus

P0,x (M,n,L)
Pe (M,n1 ,L1 ,0)

≥ P0,x (L1 + 1, (n − n1 ), L) .

As we have done in the errors-and-erasures case we can convert this into a bound on exponents. If we use the
improved version of Haroutunian’s bound, i.e. Lemma 4, as an upper bound on the error exponent of erasure free
block codes we get the following.

Theorem 6: For any rate R ≥ 0 for any α ∈ R


Ex (R) ≤ αẼH R

Now let us focus on the value of erasure exponent at zero rate:
Lemma 5: For the channels which has zero zero-error capacity, i.e. C0 = 0, erasure exponent of error free block
codes at zero rate Ex (0) is equal to the erasure exponent of error free block codes with two messages Ex,2 .
Note that unlike the two message case, Ex,2 , in the zero rate case Ex (0) the number of messages are increasing with
block length to infinity, thus we can not claim Ex,2 = Ex (0) just as a result of their definitions.
23

Proof: If we write Theorem 5 for L = 1, n1 = 0 and L1 = 1
P0,x (M, n, 1) ≥ Pe (M, 0, 1)P0,x (2, n, 1)
=

M −1
M P0,x (2, n, 1)

∀M, n

Thus as an immediate result of the definitions of Ex (0) and Ex,2, we have Ex (0) ≤ Ex,2 .
In order to prove the equality one needs to prove Ex (0) ≥ Ex,2 . For doing that let us assume that it is possible to
send one bit with erasure probability ǫ with a block code of length ℓ(ǫ):
ǫ ≥ P0,x (2, ℓ(ǫ), 1)

(85)

One can use this code to send r bits, by repeating each bit whenever there exists an erasure. If the block length is
n = kℓ(ǫ) then a message erasure occurs only when the number of bit erasures in k trials is more then k − r . Let #e
denote the number of erasures out of k trials then

Thus any exponent achievable for two message case is achievable for zero rate case: Ex (0) ≥ Ex,2.

C. Lower Bounds on P0,x (2, n, 1)

Suppose at time t the correct message, M, is assigned to the input letter x and the other message
P is assigned to the
input letter x̃ , then the receiver can not to rule out the incorrect message at time t with probability y:W (y|x̃ )>0 W (y|x ).
Using this fact one can prove that,



(87)

We denote the output letter that can be reached from both of the input letters by ỹ . For the moment we consider only
the deterministic encoding schemes, i.e. Zt = Yt . Note that in the optimal encoding scheme,
Xt (1, y t−1 ) 6= Xt (2, y t−1 )

(88)

Furthermore if Yn = ỹ n then the receiver can not decode without errors, i.e. it has to declare an erasure. Then,
P0,x (2, n, 1) ≥ 12 (P[Yn = ỹ ỹ . . . ỹ| M = 1] + P[Yn = ỹ ỹ . . . ỹ| M = 2])

(89)

where (a) hods because arithmetic mean is larger than the geometric mean and (b) follows from the equation (88).
For the W given in (87) the bound given in (89) is very tight. If the encoder assigns the first message to the input
letter that always leads to ỹ and the second message to the other input letter in first ⌊ n2 ⌋ time instances, and does
n

the flipped assignment in the last ⌈ n2 ⌉ time instances, then an erasure happens with a probability less than q ⌊ 2 ⌋ , i.e.
n

P0,x (2, n, 1) ≤ q ⌊ 2 ⌋ .
On the other hand for the W given in (87), bound given in equation (86) ensures only P0,x (2, n, 1) ≥ q n , rather
n
than P0,x (2, n, 1) ≥ q ⌊ 2 ⌋ . Thus for the channel given (87) the bound given in equation (89) is tighter than the one in
equation (86).
The idea used in deriving the bound given in equation (89) for this particular W can be applied to a general DMC
to prove the following lower bound,

The bound given in equation (90) is decaying exponentially in n, even when all entries of the W are positive, however
for those channels the bound given in (86) implies P0,x (2, n, 1) ≥ 1. Thus the bound given in (90) can not be superior
to the bound given in equation (86) in general. The following bound implies bounds given in both equation (86) and
equation (90). Furthermore for certain channels it is strictly better than both.
Lemma 6: Erasure probability of all error free block codes with two messages is lower bounded as

Note that bounds given in equation (86) and (90) are implied by lims→0+ β(s) and lims→0.5− β(s) respectively.
P
Although y W (y|x )s W (y|x̃ )1−s is convex in s on (0, 0.5) for all (x , x̃ ) pairs, β(s) is not convex in s because of the
minimization in its definition. Thus the supremum over s does not necessarily occur on the boundaries. Indeed there
are channels for which bound given in Lemma 6 is strictly better than the bounds given in (86) and (90). Following

VI. D ISCUSSION
The value of error exponent is not known for erasure free fixed length block codes with feedback on a general
DMC. We do not even know if it is still upper bounded by sphere packing exponent for non-symmetric DMCs.
Yet the value of error exponent for fixed length block codes with feedback and errors-and-erasures decoding can be
deduced, for the zero-erasure exponent case, from the results on the variable length block codes [3], [34]. Our main
aim in this paper was establishing upper and lower bounds that extend the bounds at the zero erasure exponent case
gracefully and non-trivially to the positive erasure exponents values. Our results are best understood in this framework
and should be interpreted accordingly.
By finding the optimal error exponent erasure exponent trade off, one solves the open problem of finding the optimal
error exponent of erasure free fixed length block codes with feedback. This is an important and difficult problem on
its own right. We did not attempted to solve that problem, yet the inner and outer bounds we have derived for the
case with erasure quantify how much we loose from the optimal performance by using the encoding schemes inspired
by the optimal encoding schemes for variable length block codes.
We derived inner bounds using two phase encoding schemes, which are known to be optimal at zero-erasure
exponent case. We have improved the performance of these two phase schemes at positive erasure exponent values by
choosing relative durations of the phases considering the desired values of rate and erasure exponent, and by using a
decoder that takes into account the outputs of both phases while deciding between decoding to a message and declaring
26

an erasure. However within each phase the assignment of messages to input letters is fixed. In a general feedback
encoder, on the other hand, assignment of the messages to input symbols at each time can depend on the previous
channel outputs and such encoding schemes have proven to improve the error exponent at low rates, [35], [13], [6],
[25], [23] for some DMCs. Using such an encoding in the communication phase will improve the performance at low
rates. In addition instead of committing to a fixed duration for the communication phase one might consider using
a stopping time to switch from communication phase to the control phase. However in order to apply those ideas
effectively for a general DMC, it seems one first needs to solve the problem for the erasure free block codes for a
general DMC.
We derived the outer bounds without making any assumption about the feedback encoding scheme. Thus they are
valid for any fixed length block code with feedback and erasures. The principal idea of the straight line bound is
making use of the bounds derived for different rate, erasure exponent pairs by taking their convex combinations. This
approach can be interpreted as a generalization of the outer bounds used for variable length block codes, [3], [2].
As it was the case for the inner bounds, it seems in order to improve the outer bounds one needs establish outer
bounds on two related problems, i.e. on the error exponents of erasure free block codes with feedback and on the
error exponent erasure exponent trade off at zero rate.
The inner and outer bounds we have derived do not coincide for arbitrary values of erasure exponent. But they do
coincide for all channels at all rates at zero erasure exponent.
• If the channel does not have a zero probability transition, both the inner bound and the outer bound are equal to
(1 − R
C )D .
• If the channel does have a zero probability transition, the inner bound is equal to infinity and there are fixed
length block codes with zero error probability for all large enough block lengths.
Furthermore on the plane where erasure exponent is equal to the error exponent, the outer bound we have derived
is loose only as much as the best outer bound we know for the error exponent of the erasure free block codes with
feedback is loose. Thus the proximity we have observed between inner and outer bounds in Figure 1 is not peculiar
to the particular channel we have chosen for Figure 1. For all channels inner and outer bounds we have derived
coincide on the upper left corner like they do in Figure 1. If the channel is symmetric and if we are considering a
rate over critical rate they will also coincide in lower right corner. Furthermore if the sphere packing exponent is
shown to be an upper bound for the error exponent of erasure free fixed length block codes this behavior will extend
to non-symmetric channels.

A PPENDIX
A. The Error Exponent Trade Off for Feedback Encoding Schemes with Two Message and Erasure Free Decoders :
In this section we will first establish an alternative expression for the Γ (T, Π) function defined in equation (36)
in Lemma 7. After that we will prove that in a two message code with feedback on a DMC, if the error exponent
of one of the messages is greater than some T ≥ T0 then the error exponent of the other message cannot be greater
than Γ (T ), where T0 and Γ (T ) are defined in (64) and (65) respectively. Furthermore we will prove that if the
error probability of the one of the message is zero than the error probability of the other message cannot be lower
than e−nT0 ; we will also prove that it can be as low as e−nT0 , see Lemma 8. These results will imply that the error
performance of a two message code, does not improve with feedback. This result is attributed to Shannon and Gallager
by Berlekamp in [1].

Now we are ready to present the proof of Lemma 3

Proof [Lemma 3]:
Our proof is very much like the one for the converse part of [31, Theorem 5], except few modifications that allow
us to handle the fact that encoding schemes we are considering are feedback encoding schemes. Like [31, Theorem
5] we construct a probability measure PT [·] on Z n as a function of T and the encoding scheme. Then we bound the
error probability of each message from below using the probability of the decoding region of the other message
under PT [·]. We consider probability measures on Z n rather than Yn to include the possible randomization in the
encoding and decoding schemes.
For any T ≥ T0 and Π, let ST,Π be

Note that given Zt−1 = z t−1 channel input letters assigned to each message at time t, Xt (m1 , z t−1 ) and
Xt (m2 , z t−1 ), are fixed for any feedback encoding schemes, Xt (·) : {m1 , m2 } × Z t−1 . Thus the corresponding Π is

PT [χ(m)] ≥ 3/4

m = m1 , m2

Hence,
PT [χ(m1 ) ∩ χ(m2 )] ≥ 1/2

Thus either the total probability of intersection of χ(m1 ) ∩ χ(m2 ) with the decoding region of the second message
is equal to or larger than 1/4 or the total probability of intersection of χ(m1 ) ∩ χ(m2 ) with the decoding region of
the first message is strictly larger than 1/4. Then the lemma follows from equations (110) and (113).
QED
As we have noted previously T0 does have an operational meaning it is the maximum error exponent first message
can have, when the error probability of the second message is zero.
Lemma 8: For any feedback encoding scheme with two messages, if Pe|m2 = 0 then Pe|m1 ≥ e−nT0 . Furthermore
there does exist an encoding scheme such that Pe|m2 = 0 then Pe|m1 = e−nT0 .
Proof: Let us use a construction similar to the one used in the proof of Lemma 3


PT Yt | Zt−1 = U0 (Yt |Xt (m1 , Zt−1 ), Xt (m2 , Zt−1 )).

As we did in the proof of Lemma 3 we will assume that conditional distribution of At given (M, Zt−1 , Yt ) under
PT [·] is identical to the conditional distribution of At given (M, Zt−1 , Yt ) under P[·], i.e. the original conditional
distribution.
Then for any event B measurable in the sigma field generated by Zn we have

Let us assume that maximizing x-pair in (64) is (x1∗ , x2∗ ) i.e. T0 = − ln y:W (y|x2∗)>0 W (y|x1∗ ). If the the encoding

Yt = y ∗ for some t ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} and for some y ∗ such that W (y ∗ |x2∗ ) = 0. Then Pem2 = 0 and Pem1 = e−nT0 .

If the set that a minimization is done over is enlarged, then the resulting minimum does not increase. Using this

Note that for all P ∈ P (R, Ex , α) if use the inequalities (120) and (121) together the definition of Ee given in
equation (14) and (19) we get,
Ee (R, Ex , α(R, Ex ), P, ΠP ) ≥ Ee (R, Ex , 1, P, ΠP ) + δP

for some δP > 0. Consequently for all P ∈ P (R, Ex , α), equation (119) holds.
Note that for all Π and for all P ∈ P (R, Ex , α)
Ee (R, Ex , 1, P, ΠP ) = Ee (R, Ex , 1, P, Π).

Thus we have:
max Ee (R, Ex , α, P, Π) > max Ee (R, Ex , 1, P, Π)
