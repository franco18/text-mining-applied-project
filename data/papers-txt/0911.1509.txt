On The Development of Low-power MAC
Protocol for WBANs
Sana Ullah Member IAENG, Pervez Khan, and Kyung Sup Kwak

Abstract- Current advances in wireless communication,
microelectronics, semiconductor technologies, and intelligent
sensors have contributed to the development of unobtrusive
WBANs. These networks provide long term health monitoring
of patients without any constraint in their normal activities.
Traditional MAC protocols do not accommodate the assorted
WBAN traffic requirements in a power efficient manner. In
this paper, we present a brief discussion on the development
process of a low power MAC protocol for WBANs. We observe
the behavior of a beacon-enabled IEEE 802.15.4 for on-body
sensor networks. We further propose a low power technique
called traffic based wakeup mechanism for a WBAN that exploits
the traffic patterns of the BAN Nodes to ensure power efficient
and reliable communication.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular disease is the foremost cause of death in the
United States and Europe since 1900. More than ten million
people are affected in Europe, one million in the US, and
twenty two million people in the world [1] – [3]. The number
is projected to be triple by 2020, or 20% of the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP). The ratio is 17% in South Korea
and 39% in UK [4]-[5]. The healthcare expenditure in the US
is expected to increase from 2.9 trillion in 2009 to 4 trillion in
2015 [6]. The impending health crisis attracts researchers,
industrialists, and economists towards optimal and quick
health solutions. The non-intrusive and ambulatory health
monitoring of patient’s vital signs with real time updates of
medical records via internet provides economical solutions to
the health care systems.
A WBAN contains a number of portable, miniaturised, and
autonomous sensor nodes that monitors the body function for
sporting, health, entertainment, and emergency applications.
It provides long term health monitoring of patients under
natural physiological states without constraining their normal
activities. In-body sensor networks allow communication
between implanted devices and remote monitoring
equipments. They may be used to collect information from
Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) in order to

detect and treat ventricular tachyarrhythmia 1 and prevent
Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) [7].
A number of ongoing projects such as CodeBlue,
MobiHealth, and iSIM have contributed to establish a
proactive and unobtrusive WBAN system [8]-[10]. A system
architecture presented in [11] performs real time analysis of
sensor’s data, provides real time feedback to the user, and
forwards the user’s information to a telemedicine server.
UbiMon aims to develop a smart and affordable health care
system [12]. MIT Media Lab is developing MIThril that
gives a complete insight of human-machine interface [13]
HIT lab focuses on quality interfaces and innovative
wearable computers [14]. IEEE 802.15.6 aims to provide
low-power in-body and on-body wireless communication
standards for medical and non-medical applications [15].
NASA is developing a wearable physiological monitoring
system for astronauts called LifeGuard system [16]. ETRI
focuses on the development of a low power MAC protocol
for a WBAN [17].
In this paper, we focus on the development of a low power
MAC protocol for in-body and on-body sensor networks. We
use the terms BAN Node (BN) and BAN Network
Coordinator (BNC) for the sensor node and the network
coordinator in a WBAN. The rest of the paper is organized
into five sections. Section II presents the WBAN traffic
classification. Section III and IV discuss MAC for on-body
and in-body sensor networks including a performance
analysis of several low power MAC protocols. Section V
presents a low power technique called traffic based wakeup
mechanism. Section VI concludes our work.
II. TRAFFIC CLASSIFICATION
The assorted WBAN traffic requires sophisticated and
power efficient techniques to ensure safe and reliable
operation. Existing MAC protocols such as SMAC [18],
TMAC [19], IEEE 802.15.4 [20], and WiseMAC [21] give
limited answers to the heterogeneous traffic. The in-body
BNs do not appreciate synchronized wakeup periods because
they confine the accommodation of sporadic emergency
events. Medical data usually needs high priority and
reliability than non-medical data. In case of emergency
events, the BNs should be able to access the channel in less
than one second [22]. IEEE 802.15.4 Guaranteed Time Slots
(GTS) can be utilized to handle time critical events but they
expire in case of a low traffic. Furthermore, some in-body
BNs have high data transmission frequency than others. We
classify the entire WBAN traffic into Normal, On-demand,

and Emergency traffics as given in Fig 1. The normal traffic
is further classified into High, Medium, and Low traffics.
A- Normal Traffic: Normal traffic is the data traffic in a
normal condition with no time critical and on-demand events.
This includes unobtrusive and routine health monitoring of a
patient for diagnosis and treatment of many diseases such as
gastrointestinal tract, neurological disorders, cancer
detection, handicap rehabilitation, and the most threatening
heart disease. Some BNs have frequent wakeup periods and
thus are designated as high traffic BNs. For example, an ECG
node may send data 4 times per hour, while other BNs may
send 4 times a day. The ECG node is thus designated as a
high traffic BN. However, the normal traffic classification
from high to low and vice-versa depends on the application
requirements. The normal data is collected and processed by
the BNC.

research topic for the last few years. A novel TDMA protocol
for on-body sensor network called H-MAC exploits the
biosignal features to perform TDMA synchronization and
improves the energy efficiency [23]. Other protocols like
WASP, CICADA, and BSN-MAC are investigated in [24] –
[26]. The performance analysis of a non-beacon IEEE
802.15.4 is adapted to extend lifetime of a node from 10 to 15
years [27]. This work considers low upload/download rates,
mostly per hour. Further the data transmission is based on
periodic intervals, which limits the performance to certain
applications. There is no reliable support for on-demand and
emergency traffics. Intel Corporation has carried out a series
of experiments to analyze the performance of IEEE 802.15.4
for an on-body sensor network [28]. They deployed a number
of Intel Mote 2 [29] devices on chest, waist, and the right
ankle. Experimental results show that the packet delivery
ratios are 100%, 99%, and 84% at waist, chest, and ankle
respectively. The connection between ankle and waist cannot
be established, even for a short distance of 1.5 meters.
We present the performance analysis of a beacon-enabled
IEEE 802.15.4, Preamble-Based TDMA [30], and SMAC
protocols for on-body sensor networks. Our analysis is
verified by extensive simulations using NS-2. Simulation
results show that IEEE 802.15.4, when configured in a
beacon-enabled mode, outperforms SMAC and PB-TDMA
as shown in Fig 2. However, the precise location of BNs and
the body position influence the packet delivery ratio.

B- On-demand Traffic: On-demand traffic is initiated by the
BNC or doctor to know certain information, mostly for the
purpose of diagnosis and prescription. This is further divided
into continuous (in case of surgical events) and
non-continuous (when limited information is required).
C- Emergency Traffic: This is initiated by BNs when they
exceed a predefined threshold and should be accommodated
in less than one second. This kind of traffic is not generated
on regular intervals.
III. ON-BODY SENSOR NETWORK
On-body sensor networks comprise of miniaturized and
non-invasive sensor nodes that are used for various
applications, ranging from medical to interactive gaming and
entertainment applications. They use Wireless Medical
Telemetry Services (WMTS), unlicensed ISM, and UWB
bands for data transmission. WMTS is a licensed band
designated for medical telemetry system. Federal
Communication Commission (FCC) urges the use of WMTS
for medical applications due to fewer interfering sources.
However, only authorized users such as physicians and
trained technicians are eligible to use this band. Further the
restricted WMTS (14 MHz) bandwidth cannot support video
and voice transmission. The alternative spectrum for medical
applications is to use 2.4 GHz ISM band that includes guard
bands to protect adjacent channel interference. UWB is a
promising candidate to satisfy the baseline power
consumption requirements of on-body sensor networks.
The design and implementation of a low power MAC
protocol for on-body sensor networks have been a hot

IN-BODY SENSOR NETWORK

In-body sensor networks allow communication between
implanted BNs and external monitoring equipments. Unlike
on-body BNs, in-body BNs are implanted under human skin
where the electrical properties of the body affect the signal
propagations. The human body is a medium that poses many
wireless transmission challenges. The body is composed of
several components that are not predictable and will change.
Monitoring in-body functions and the ability to communicate
with implanted therapeutic devices, such as pacemakers, are
essential for their best use. Applications include monitoring
and programme changes for pacemakers and ICDs, control of
bladder function, and restoration of limb movement. The
space within a body is very limited and the available
materials are few. These applications may require continuous
or occasional one or two-way transmission. Some
applications will require a battery where the current drain

must be low so as not to reduce the working life of the
implant function.
Zarlink semiconductor has introduced a wireless chip that
supports a very high data rate RF link for communication
with an implantable BN [31]. The ZL70101 ultra-low power
transceiver chip satisfies the power and size requirements for
implanted communication systems and operates in 402-405
MHz MICS band [32]-[33]. Other frequency bands such as
916MHz, 1.5GHz, and Ultra-Wideband are also considered
for in-body sensor networks [34]-[36]. The use of open air
models for implant communication is discouraged in [37]. A
Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) is used to calculate
the power deposition in a human head and is measured by the
SAR in W/Kg [38]. However, the distance from the implant
source has not been discussed. For 0.05% duty cycle at 400
kbps, the SubQore radio architecture from Cambridge
university consumes a peak current less than 1.7mA [39]. An
implantable medical microsystems for interfaces to the
central nervous system is presented in [40].
The diverse nature of in-body BNs together with the
electrical properties of the human body influences the
development process of a low power and heterogeneous
MAC for in-body sensor networks. The data rate of
implanted BNs varies, ranging from few kbps in pacemaker
to several Mbps in capsular endoscope. Fig 3 explains the
in-body sensor networks and implementation issues [41].

techniques, i.e., Preamble Detector and De-correlation Based
Detector can be investigated for in-body BNs. Preamble
detector indicates a busy channel only on detecting the
preamble part of the frame. De-correlation on the other hand,
looks for certain spreading characteristics other than
preamble.

Fig 3. Implementation issues in the in-body sensor network

In the in-body sensor network, critical data requires low
latency and high reliability. The solution is to adjust initial
back-off windows for critical and non-critical traffics [42].
Non-critical BNs have larger initial back-off window than
critical BNs, i.e., (W0α ≤ W0β) where W0α is initial back-off
window for critical BNs α and W0β is initial back-off window
for non-critical BNs β. Fig 4 illustrates the average packet
latency for a number of in-body BNs. The smaller initial
back-off window for the critical BNs results in lower latency.
The Fig also shows packet latency of a standard CSMA/CA
scheme used in IEEE 802.15.4.
The traditional CSMA/CA technique does not provide
reliable solution in multiple piconets [41]. For a threshold of
-85dBm and -95dBm, the on-body BNs cannot see the
activity of in-body BNs when they are away at 3 meters
distance from the body surface as given in Fig 5. However, in
3 meters or less distance, the CCA works correctly in the
same piconet. The main reason of improper energy detection
is that the path loss inside human body is much higher than in
free space. However, the performance of other CCA

TRAFFIC BASED WAKEUP MECHANISM FOR WBAN

The heterogeneous BNs require power efficient and
dynamic wakeup techniques for reliable operation. We
propose a low power technique called traffic based wakeup
mechanism that exploits the traffic patterns of BNs to
accommodate the assorted WBAN traffic. The initial wakeup
patterns are either predefined (by the company) or created
and modified (by the BNC). Table 1 shows the
aforementioned traffic classification and the corresponding
solutions.

The wakeup patterns of all BNs are organized into a table
called traffic based wakeup table. The table is maintained
and modified by the BNC according to the requirements.
Based on the BNs wakeup patterns, the BNC can also
calculate its own wakeup pattern. This could save significant
energy at the BNC. The BNC does not need to stay active
when there is no traffic from the BNs. The designation of
normal traffic levels, i.e, high, medium, and low traffics BNs
depend on the application. For example, some BNs may
repeat their wakeup patterns per BAN superframe and thus
are designated as high traffic BNs. Others may repeat per
hour (medium traffic BNs) and per day (low traffic BNs). Fig
6 shows the repetition of wakeup patterns in a multiple
number of BAN superframes . In this case, BN-1 is a high
traffic node having a wakeup pattern equal to 10x where x is
the duration of a single BAN superframe. BN-3 is the low
traffic BN having a wakeup pattern equal to 43x. BNs having
the same wakeup patterns contend for the channel.

CCA for in-body sensor networks is not a reliable approach
due to high path loss inside the human body. We proposed a
low power traffic based wakeup mechanism for a WBAN that
exploits the traffic patterns of BNs to accommodate the entire
traffic classification. In future, we will extend our technique
towards a complete implementation. Our proposed approach
will provide a power efficient and innovative solution for
in-body and on-body sensor networks.

In case of TDMA, the wakeup patterns represent the
corresponding slots in the TDMA superframe. The data slots
are active according to the wakeup patterns. For example,
10x would allow using the BN-1 data slot after 10 TDMA
superframes.
For emergency and on-demand traffics, the BNs and the
BNC send a wake-up signal for a very short duration to each
other. However, traditional wake-up radio concepts have
several limitations when considered in the in-body sensor
networks. They are not able to wake-up a particular node. All
BNs wake-up in response to a single wake-up signal, which is
not the required environment. The use of different radio
frequencies to wake-up a particular node may provide an
optimal solution.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we presented a technical discussion on low
power MAC protocols for a heterogeneous in-body and
on-body sensor networks. The traffic is classified into
normal, on-demand, and emergency traffics. For emergency
events, the BNs should be able to access the channel in less
than one second. Furthermore, the beacon enabled IEEE
802.15.4 transcended other low power MAC protocols in
terms of throughput. However, it is not sufficient to
accommodate the entire WBAN traffic characteristics
including time critical events. Time critical events require
low latency and high reliability. The adjustment of initial
back-off window in the traditional CSMA/CA technique
provides limited solution. But the use of energy detection
