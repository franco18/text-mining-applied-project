ON UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLES IN THE FINITE DIMENSIONAL
SETTING
SAIFALLAH GHOBBER AND PHILIPPE JAMING
Abstract. The aim of this paper is to prove an uncertainty principle for the representation
of a vector in two bases. Our result extends previously known “qualitative” uncertainty
principles into more quantitative estimates. We then show how to transfer such results to
the discrete version of the Short Time Fourier Transform.

1. Introduction
The aim of this paper is to deal with uncertainty principles in finite dimensional settings.
Usually, an uncertainty principle says that a function and its Fourier transform can not be
both well concentrated. Of course, one needs to give a precise meaning to “well concentrated”
and we refer to [18, 14] for numerous versions of the uncertainty principle for the Fourier
transform in various settings. Our aim here is to present results of that flavour for unitary
operators on Cd and then to apply those results to the discrete short-time Fourier transform.
Let us now be more precise and describe our main results and the relations with existing
literature.
1.1. Main results. Before presenting our results, we need some further notation. Let d be
an integer and ℓ2d be Cd equipped with its standard norm denoted kakℓ2 or simply kak2 and
the associated scalar product h·, ·i. More generally, for 0 < p < +∞, the ℓp -“norm” is defined
1/p

. For a set E ⊂ {0, . . . , d− 1} we will write E c for its complement,

|E| for the number of its elements. Further, for a = (a0 , . . . , ad−1 ) ∈ ℓ2d , we denote kakℓ2 (E) =
1
P
2 2 . Finally, the support of a is defined as supp a = {j : a 6= 0} and we set
|a

j

j∈E
kakℓ0 = |supp a|.
Our aim here is to deal with finite dimensional analogues of the uncertainty principle. Here,
instead of the Fourier transform, we will consider general unitary operators, (i.e. a change
of coordinates from one orthonormal bases to another one), and concentration is measured
in the following sense:
Definition.
Let Φ = {Φj }j=0,...,d−1 and Ψ = {Ψj }j=0,...,d−1 be two orthonormal bases of ℓ2d . Let S, Σ ⊂
{0, . . . , d − 1}. Then (S, Σ) is said to be a

Σ implies that a = 0;

— strong annihilating pair (for those bases) if there exists a constant C(S, Σ) such that
for every a ∈ ℓ2d

(1.1)
kakℓ2 ≤ C(S, Σ) kha, Φj ikℓ2 (S c ) + kha, Ψj ikℓ2 (Σc ) .

Of course, any strong annihilating pair is also a weak one. This notion is an adaptation of
a similar one for the Fourier transform for which it has been extensively studied. We refer
to [18, 14] for more references. The advantage of the second notion over the first one is that
it states that if the coordinates of a in the basis Φ outside S and those of a in the basis Ψ
outside Σ are small, then a itself is small.
It follows from a standard compactness argument (that we reproduce after Formula (2.5)
below) that, in a finite dimensional setting, both notions are equivalent. However, this
argument does not give any information on C(S, Σ). It is our aim here to modify an argument
from [12] to obtain quantitative information on this constant in terms of S and Σ. More
precisely, we will prove the following Uncertainty Principles:
Theorem A.
Let d be an integer. Let Φ = {Φj }j=0,...,d−1 and Ψ = {Ψj }j=0,...,d−1 be two orthonormal bases
of Cd and define the coherence of Φ, Ψ by M (Φ, Ψ) = max |hΦj , Ψk i|. Let S, Σ be two

As a first corollary of this result, we will show that a sequence may not be too compressive in
two different bases (see Corollary 2.4 for a precise statement). Further, we show in Proposition
2.7 that, if M (Φ, Ψ) = d−1/2 (in which case, the bases are said to be unbiased), then any
set Σ that is not too large is a member of a strong annihilating pair. More precisely, if
√
(d − |Σ|)2
|Σ| ≤ d − 240d, there exists a set S such that |S| ≥
and (S, Σ) is a strong
240d
annihilating pair.
Let us stress that all results mentioned so far apply to the discrete Fourier transform Fd
which may be seen as the unitary operator that changes the standard basis ∆ = {δj }j=0,...,d−1
of ℓ2d into the Fourier basis defined by Ψ = {Ψj }j=0,...,d−1 with
Ψj = Fd [δj ] = d−1/2 (1, . . . , e2iπjk/d , . . . , e2iπj(d−1)/d ).
Note that these two bases are unbiased.
Finally, we will apply our results to the discrete short-time Fourier transform. Let us
describe these results in a slightly simplified setting. First, for d an integer, we will consider
elements of ℓ2d as d-periodic functions on {0, . . . , d − 1}. For f, g ∈ ℓ2d , the short-time (or
windowed) Fourier transform of f with window g is then defined for j, k ∈ {0, . . . , d − 1} by
d−1

f (ℓ)g(ℓ − j)e2iπkℓ/d .

Note that, if we write τj g(ℓ) = g(ℓ−j), then Vg f (j, k) = Fd [f τj g](k), so the windowed Fourier
transform can be seen as the Fourier transform of f seen through a sliding window g. We
refer to e.g. [20, 19, 25] for various applications of the discrete short-time Fourier transform
in signal processing. Our aim is to show that this transform satisfies an uncertainty principle:
Theorem B.
Let Σ be a subset of {0, . . . , d − 1}2 with |Σ| < d and g ∈ ℓ2d with kgk2 = 1. Then for every
f ∈ ℓ2d ,

(j,k)∈Σ
/

Following [25], the definition of the windowed Fourier transform will be extended to the
setting of finite Abelian groups. We will prove an analogue of the above theorem in that
general setting.

1.2. Comparison with existing results. .
The two uncertainty principles given in Theorems A and B are quantitative improvements
of known results.
First, uncertainty principles for the discrete Fourier transform Fd are known for some
time. To our knowledge, the first occurrence of such a result is due to Matolcsi-Szucs[26] and
was rediscovered by Donoho-Stark [12]. More precisely, if one considers Fd as the change of
coordinate operator from the standard basis to the Fourier basis then Theorem A reads as
follows: if |S||Σ| < d then

In particular, if a is supported in S and Fd [a] is supported in Σ, then a = 0, which is the
result proved in [26, 12].
This result may also be seen as a discrete counterpart of an uncertainty principle for the
continuous Fourier transform on L2 (Rn ) originally proved by F. Nazarov for n = 1 [28] and
the second author for arbitrary dimension [23]. This was one of the motivations in writing
this paper.
At this stage, we would also like to mention that T. Tao [32] proved that, if the dimension
d is a prime number, and if |S| + |Σ| ≤ d, than (S, Σ) is an annihilating pair. Unfortunately,
Tao’s proof does not give any information on the constant C(S, Σ), and our method of proof
does not recover his result neither. For sake of completeness, we would like to mention the
work of Meshulam [27] and Delvaux-Van Barel [8, 9] that pursue Tao’s work.
Further, Donoho-Huo [11] considered other particular pairs of bases. For the general case
of two arbitrary bases, Theorem 2.3 gives a quantitative version of a result of Elad-Bruckstein
[13]. Note that Elad-Bruckstein’s result was extended to more than two bases by GribonvalNielsen [16]. Note also that [11, 13, 16] further deal with the problem of recovering a vector
that is sparse (i.e. with small support) in one basis from knowledge of a small number of its
coordinates in an other basis via ℓ1 -minimization, an issue we do not tackle here.
Next, if the sets S, Σ are chosen randomly, then one may improve the result in Theorem A.
This was done for the discrete Fourier transform by Candès-Tao and almost simultaneously

4

by Rudelson-Vershynin [30] who obtained a slightly better result that also applies to unbiased
bases. As we will use it for the discrete short-time Fourier transform, we will reproduce the
result in Theorem 2.5. Further results of probabilistic nature may be found in the work of
Tropp [35, 34].
Finally, the uncertainty principle for the short-time Fourier transform that we prove here is
a quantitative strengthening of the main result of Krahmer, Pfander, Rashkov [25]. Its proof
is an adaptation of a method that was originally developed in [22, 24] and improved in [10, 17]
in the continuous setting. More precisely, we first prove that the discrete Fourier transform
of the product of two short-time Fourier transforms is again a product of short-time Fourier
transforms (Lemma 3.1). This allows us to prove a transfer principle from strong annihilating
pairs for the discrete Fourier transform into a similar result for its short-time version (Lemma
3.2). From this, we deduce Theorem B (in a more general version, Corollary 3.3) as well as
a “probabilistic improvement” (Corollary 3.4).
1.3. Link with compressive sensing. Although our results do not apply directly to the
blooming subject of compressed sensing, this subject was one of the motivations of our research. Let us recall that the Uniform Uncertainty Principle was introduced by E. Candès
and T. Tao in their seminal series of papers [4, 5, 6, 7].
Definition.
Let T : ℓ2d → ℓ2d be a unitary operator. Let s ≤ d be an integer and Ω ⊂ {0, . . . , d − 1}.
Then (T, Ω, s) is said to have the Uniform Uncertainty Principle (also called the Restricted
Isometry Property) if there exists δs ∈ (0, 1) such that, for every S ⊂ {0, . . . , d − 1} with
|S| = s and for every a ∈ ℓ2d with supp a ⊂ S

|Ω|
|Ω|
kak22 ≤ kT ak2ℓ2 (Ω) ≤ (1 + δs ) kak22
d
d
We will call δs the Restricted Isometry Constant of (T, Ω, s).
The purpose of this property was to show that, one may recover a from the knowledge of
PΩ T a (where PΩ is the projection onto the coordinates in Ω), under the restriction of a to
be sufficiently sparse, that is |supp a| to be sufficiently small. Moreover, if δ2s is sufficiently
small, a may be reconstructed by an ℓ1 -minimization program (see the paper of Candès [3]
and Foucard-Lai [15] for the best results to date).
Let us now mention how the Uniform Uncertainty Principle (UUP) is linked to the notion of
annihilating pairs. If (T, Ω, s) has the UUP with constant δs then for every S of cardinality s,
(S, Ωc ) is an annihilating pair for the standard basis ∆ = {δj }0≤j≤d−1 and the orthonormal
basis T ∆ = {T δj }0≤j≤d−1 . More precisely, a standard computation (see (2.7) where we
reproduce the simple argument) shows that

Conversely, assume that Σ is such that, for every S such that |S| = s, (S, Σ) is a strong
annihilating pair for ∆ and T ∆. Let C(Σ) = sup|S|=s C(S, Σ), then (T, Σc , s) satisfies the

Outline of the paper. This article is organized as follows: in the next section, we prove
results about strong annihilating pairs for a change of basis. The following section deals
with applications to the short-time Fourier transform. We devote the last section to a short
conclusion.
2. The Uncertainty Principle for expansions in two bases.
2.1. Further notations on Hilbert spaces.
Let Φ = {Φj }j=0,...,d−1 be a basis of Cd that is normalized i.e. kΦj k2 = 1 for all j. If

a ∈ Cd , then we may write a =
i=0

suppΦ a = {i : ai 6= 0}. We also define kakℓ2 (Φ,E) in the obvious way when E is a subset of
{0, . . . , d − 1}. When no confusion can arise, we simply write kakℓ2 (E) .
Next, we will denote by Φ∗ = {Φ∗j }j=0,...,d−1 the dual basis1 of Φ. More precisely, Φ∗ is
(
0 if j 6= k
the basis defined by hΦj , Φ∗k i = δj,k where δj,k is the Kronecker symbol, δj,k =

Moreover, there exist two positive numbers α(Φ) and β(Φ), called the lower and upper Riesz
bounds of Φ such that

Note that, if we take a = Φk , we obtain α(Φ) ≤ 1 ≤ β(Φ). Moreover, α(Φ) = β(Φ) = 1 if
and only if Φ is orthonormal.
If Φ and Ψ are two normalized bases of Cd , we will define their coherence by
M (Φ, Ψ) =

0≤j,k≤d−1

|hΦj , Ψk i|.

Obviously M (Φ, Ψ) ≤ 1 and, if Φ and Ψ are orthonormal bases, then M (Φ, Ψ) ≥ √ . If
d
M (Φ, Ψ) = √1 , then Φ and Ψ are said to be unbiased. A typical example of a pair of unbiased
d

bases is the standard basis and the Fourier basis of Cd , see Section 3.1.
1We would like to point the reader’s attention to the notation adopted here and that is standard in linear
algebra. The vectors Φj may be seen as the row (or column) vector of its coordinates in the standard basis.
Then Φ∗j may be seen as the transposed-conjugate of Φj if the basis Φj is orthonormal. In general, this is not
the case.

Remark 2.2. Let Φ and Ψ be two unbiased orthonormal bases. The lemma then reads
|suppΦ a||suppΨ a| ≥ d. We can thus reformulate the lemma as follows: if S and Σ are two
subsets of {1, . . . , d} with |S||Σ| < d, and if suppΦ a ⊂ S and suppΨ a ⊂ Σ then a = 0.
We will now switch to strong annihilating pairs. First, note that if (S, Σ) is a weak
annihilating pair, then it is also a strong annihilating pair, i.e. there exists a constant
C = C(S, Σ, Φ, Ψ) such that, for every a ∈ Cd ,


(2.5)
kak2 ≤ C kakℓ2 (Φ,S c ) + kakℓ2 (Ψ,Σc ) .

Indeed, C = D −1 where D is the minimum of kakℓ2 (Φ,S c ) + kakℓ2 (Ψ,Σc ) over a ∈ Sd−1 , the
unit sphere of Cd . This minimum is reached in some a0 ∈ Sd−1 and is thus non-zero since
(S, Σ) is a weak annihilating pair. However, this does not allow to obtain an estimate on the
constant C. This will be overcome in the next theorem, Theorem A from the introduction.
Theorem 2.3.
Let d be an integer. Let Φ and Ψ be two orthonormal bases of Cd and S, Σ be two subsets of
1
. Then for every a ∈ Cd ,

Remark :
For comparison with the previous lemma, recall that as Φ, Ψ are orthonormal they are equal
to their dual bases and that their lower and upper Riesz bounds are 1.
Proof. The proof we present here is in the spirit of [18] and is also inspired by [12].
Let U be the change of basis from Ψ to Φ, that is the linear operator defined by U Ψi = Φi .
We will still denote by U its matrix in the basis Φi , so that U = [Ui,j ]1≤i,j≤d is given by
Ui,j = hΦj , Ψi i. As U is unitary, U ∗ Φi = Ψi .
P
For a set E ⊂ {1, . . . , d} let PE be the projection PE a =
j∈E ha, Φj iΦj . A direct
computation then shows that kakℓ2 (Φ,S c ) = kPS c ak2 while

The last equality comes from the assumption suppΦ x ⊂ S which implies kak2 = kakℓ2 (Φ,S) .
Note that, if we are able to prove that kPΣ U PS kℓ2 →ℓ2 < 1, then this inequality implies that (S, Σ) is an annihilating pair. The following computation allows to estimate
the constant C(S, Σ) appearing in the definition of a strong annihilating pair: write D =

≤ DkPΣc U ak2 + DkU PS c ak2 + kPS c ak2

since kPΣc xk2 ≤ kxk2 for every x ∈ Cd . Now, as U is unitary, we get

kak2 ≤ DkPΣc U ak2 + 1 + D kPS c ak2

which immediately gives an estimate of the desired form with

It then remains to mimic the computation in (2.7) to obtain the result: write (2.9) as kak ≤
Dkakℓ2 (Ψ,Σc ) if supp Φ a ⊂ S (note that the hypothesis on S, Σ is equivalent to D > 0). Now,
if a ∈ Cd , write a = aS + aS c where supp Φ aS ⊂ S and supp Φ aS c ⊂ S c . Then

Of course, we may exchange the roles of Φ and Ψ in these computations.

In order to illustrate our main theorem, let us show that a vector can not be too compressible in two different bases. First, let us recall the definition.
Definition.
Let C > 0 and α > 1/2. We will say that a ∈ Cd is (C, α)-compressible in the basis Φ
if, for j = 0, . . . , d − 1, the j-th biggest coefficient |ha, Φi|∗ (j) of a in the basis Φ satisfies

We will restrict our statement to a simple enough case, the proof being easy to adapt to
more general settings:

2.3. Results on annihilating pairs using probability techniques.
So far, we have only used deterministic techniques, which lead to rather weak results. In
this section, we will recall some results that may be obtained using probability methods.
First, let us describe a model of random subsets of average cardinality k. Let k ≤ d
be an integer and let δ0 , . . . , δd−1 be d independent random variables take the value 1 with
probability k/d and 0 with probability 1 − k/d. We then define the random subset of average
cardinality k, Ω ⊂ {0, . . . , d − 1} by Ω = {i : δi = 1}. Those sets have of course average

P
cardinality k (which is immediate once one write 1Ω = d−1
j=0 δj 1j ). Moreover, one has the
following standard estimate (see e.g. [1, Theorems A.1.12 and A.1.13] or [21]):


k
≤ 2e−k/10 .
P |Ω − k| ≥
2
Therefore, some authors call those sets “random sets of cardinality k”. In the next section, we
will use the following result of Rudelson-Vershynin [30], (improving a result of Candès-Tao):
Theorem 2.5 (Rudelson-Vershynin [30]).
There exist two absolute constants C, c such that the following holds: let Φ = {Φ0 , . . . , Φd−1 }
and Ψ = {Ψ0 , . . . , Ψd−1 } be two unbiased orthonormal bases of Cd and let T : ℓ2d → ℓ2d be
defined by T ψj = Φj for j = 0, . . . , d − 1.
Let 0 < η < 1, t > 1 be real numbers and s ≤ d be an integer. Let k ≥ 1 be an integer such
that,
(2.10)

k ≃ (Cts log d) log(Cts log d) log2 s.

Then with probability at least 1−7e−c(1−η)t , a random set Ω of average cardinality k satisfies
√
√
k − tk ≤ |Ω| ≤ k + tk

and (T, Ω, s) satisfies the Uniform Uncertainty Principle with Restricted Isometry Constant
δs ≤ 1 − η. In particular, for any S ⊂ {0, . . . , d} with |S| ≤ s, for every a ∈ ℓ2d ,

The parameter η is not present in their statement, but it can be obtained by straightforward
modification of their proof.
log d
d

Taking s =
5 , t = 2C we obtain k ≃ d/2. Thus, with probability ≥ 1 − 7d
log d
(κ some universal constant) Ω has cardinal |Ω| = d/2 + O(d1/2 log1/2 d) and every set S with
cardinal |S| ≤ logd5 d and Ωc form a strong annihilating pair in the sense of (2.11) which may
now (for d big enough) be reduced to

2
(2.12)
kakℓ2 ≤ √ kakℓ2 (Φ,S c ) + kakℓ2 (Ψ,Ω) .
η
Another question that one may ask is the following. Given a set Σ, does there exist a
“large” set S such that (S, Σ) is an annihilating pair? In order to answer this question, let
us recall that Bourgain-Tzafriri [2] proved the following:
Theorem 2.6 (Bourgain-Tzafriri, [2]). 2
If T : ℓ2n → ℓ2n is such that kT ei k2 = 1 for i = 0, . . . , n − 1 (where the ei ’s stand for the
such
standard basis of ℓ2n ), then there exists a set σ ⊂ {0, . . . , n − 1} with |σ| ≥ 240kT nk2

that, for every a = (aj )j=0,...,n−1 with support in σ such that kT ak ≥
In other words, the matrix of T in the standard basis has a well

2The dimension of the ℓ2 space in this theorem is denoted by n as we will apply it to a n-dimensional

subspace of ℓ2d .

In other words, this theorem states that a matrix with columns of norm 1 has a wellconditioned sub-matrix of large size. The original proof of this theorem uses probabilistic
techniques (somewhat similar to those used later in [30]). Recently, an elementary constructive proof of the set σ was given by Spielman-Srivastava [31]. The values of the numerical
constants where given in [21].
We may apply this theorem in the following way: consider two mutually unbiased orthonormal bases Φ = {φj } and Ψ = {ψj } of ℓ2d and let S, Ω ⊂ {0, . . . , d − 1} be two sets with
|S| = |Ω| = n and enumerate them:
r S = {j0 , . . . , jn−1 } and Ω = {ω0 , . . . , ωn−1 }. Let T be
d
ψω for k = 0, . . . , n − 1. Then T satisfies the hypothesis
the operator defined by T φjk =

of Bourgain-Tzafriri’s Theorem and kT k2 ≤ . Thus there exists σ ⊂ S with |σ| ≥ n2 /240d
n
such that, for every a ∈ ℓ2n with support in σ,
r
1 n
kakℓ2 (Ψ,Ω) ≥
kakℓ2 (σ) .
12 d
From which we immediately deduce the following (where Σ = Ωc ):

Proposition 2.7.
Let Φ and Ψ be two mutually unbiased bases of ℓ2d and let S, Σ ⊂ {0, . . . , d − 1} be two sets
(d − |Σ|)2
and, for every a ∈ ℓ2d ,
with |S| + |Σ| = d. Then there exists σ ⊂ S such that |σ| ≥
240d


kakℓ2 (Φ,σc ) + kakℓ2 (Ψ,Σc ) .
(2.13)
kakℓ2 ≤ p

Of course, this proposition only makes sense when |Σ| ≤ d − 240d otherwise there is no
guarantee to have σ 6= ∅. We may thus rewrite (2.13) as

kakℓ2 ≤ 4d1/4 kakℓ2 (Φ,σc ) + kakℓ2 (Ψ,Σc ) .
3. The uncertainty principle for the discrete short-time Fourier transform

The short-time Fourier transform (or windowed Fourier transform) is a useful tool in timefrequency analysis and in signal processing. For f, g ∈ L2 (R), we define Vg f on R2 by the
formula
Z
Vg f (x, ξ) =

f (t)g(t − x)e−2iπtξ dξ.

This may be rewritten as Vg f (x, ξ) = F[f τx g](ξ) where F is the Fourier transform on L2 (R)
and τx g(t) = g(t − x) is the translation operator. Written like this, it is straightforward to
generalize this transform to the more general setting of locally Abelian groups G and its dual
Ĝ as
Z
(x, ξ) ∈ G × Ĝ
f (t)g(t − x)hξ, ti dν(t),
Vg f (x, ξ) =
G

where dνG is the Haar measure on G.
For the reader that is not acquainted with this general setting, it may be sufficient to
consider G = Z/dZ the cyclic group seen as {0, . . . , d − 1}, Ĝ the (multiplicative group of)

ON UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLES IN THE FINITE DIMENSIONAL SETTING

13

d-th roots of unity. Note that, if we identify the d-th root of unity e2iπk/d with the integer k,
then Ĝ is identified to {0, . . . , d − 1}.
For j ∈ G and ξ ∈ Ĝ, we write hξ, ji = ξ j . Then L2 (G) may be seen either as the set
of d-periodic sequences or as ℓ2d . If a ∈ L2 (G), the discrete Fourier transform Fd [a](k) =
d−1

aj e−2iπjk/d may be seen as a function on Ĝ if we identify k with ζ = e2iπk/d :
d j=0
X

FG [a](ζ) = √
aj hζ, ji.
d j∈{0,...,d−1}

Note that G may also be seen as the “dual group” of Ĝ if we write hj, ξi = hξ, ji for j ∈ G
and ξ ∈ Ĝ. The Fourier transform on Ĝ is then defined by

}

if we write bk for be2iπk/d (i.e. if we identify the d-th roots of unity with {0, . . . , d − 1}). Thus
the Fourier transform on Ĝ is the inverse discrete Fourier transform. Finally, we will use
the Fourier transform on G × Ĝ, this is then just the discrete Fourier transform in the first
variable and the inverse discrete Fourier transform in the second one.
Now take f, g two d-periodic sequences. With these notations, the discrete short-time
Fourier transform is defined on G × Ĝ = {0, . . . , d − 1} × {0, . . . , d − 1} as
d−1

The symmetry lemma (Lemma 3.1) then reads

Fd ⊗ Fd−1 [Vg f Vh k](j, k) = Vk f (−k, j)Vh g(−k, j).

The reader that does not want to enter the details concerning finite Abelian groups nor
the proof of the symmetry lemma may now skip the following two sections and replace G, Ĝ
by {0, . . . , d − 1} in the statements of Section 3.3.
3.1. Finite Abelian groups.
In this section, we recall some notations on the Fourier transform on finite Abelian groups.
Results stated here may be found in [33] and (with slightly modified notations) in [25].
Throughout the remaining of this paper, we will denote by G a finite Abelian group for
which the group law will be denoted additively. The identity element of G is denoted by
0. The dual group of characters Ĝ of G is the set of homomorphisms ξ ∈ Ĝ which map
G into the multiplicative group S1 = {z ∈ C : |z| = 1}. The set Ĝ is an Abelian group
under pointwise multiplication and, as is customary, we shall write this commutative group
operation additively. Note that G is isomorphic to Ĝ, in particular |G| = |Ĝ|. Further,
b̂
Pontryagin duality implies that G can be canonically identified with G, a fact which is
emphasized by writing hξ, xi = ξ(x). Note that, as group operations are written additively,
h−ξ, xi = hξ, −xi = hξ, xi.

We denote by π(λ) = Mξ Tx , λ = (x, ξ) ∈ G × Ĝ the time-frequency shift operators. Note
that these are unitary operators. The short-time Fourier transformation VgG : C G → CG×Ĝ

Proof. We will adapt the proof in the case G = Rd given in [10] to our situation. Let us fix
f, g ∈ CG .
We will only use Lemma 3.1 in a simple form: for a ∈ G, η ∈ Ĝ define the function Fa,η on
G × Ĝ by
Fa,η (x, ξ) = hξ − η, aiVfG g(x − a, ξ − η)VgG f (x, ξ).

G
Note that Fa,η (x, ξ) = VfG π(a, η)gVπ(a,η)g

where we inverted the summation over (a, η) and the summation over (x, ξ). Finally, summing
inequality (3.18) over (a, η) ∈ G × Ĝ gives
X
|VgG f (x, ξ)|2
kf k42 kgk42 ≤ 2C(Σ)kf k22 kgk22

which completes the proof.



Combining this result with (3.14) we immediately get the following:

The corresponding weak annihilating property for Σ was obtained by F. Krahmer, G. E.
Pfander and P. Rashkov [25].
Finally, using the fact that two random events A and B that each occur with probability
≥ 1 − α, jointly occur with probability ≥ 1 − 2α, we deduce the following from Theorem 2.5,
as reformulated in (2.12):
Corollary 3.4.
There exist two absolute constants C, c such that the following holds: Let 0 < η < 1, let g ∈ ℓ2d
with kgk2 = 1.
Then with probability at least 1 − 14|G|−c(1−η) , a random set Ω of average cardinality |G|/2
satisfies

4. Conclusion and future directions

In this paper, we have shown how to obtain quantitative uncertainty principles for the
representation of a vector in two different bases. These estimates are stated in terms of
annihilating pairs and both extend and simplify previously known qualitative results. We
then apply our main theorem to the discrete short time Fourier transform, following the path
of corresponding results in the continuous setting.

But, the family {π(x, ξ)g, x ∈ G, ξ ∈ Ĝ} forms a so-called finite (tight) Gabor frame (see [25]
and references therein for more on finite Gabor frames). In other words, we have a system
of |G||Ĝ| = |G|2 := d2 vectors e1 , . . . , ed2 in Cd such that, for every f ∈ Cd

|hf, ej i|2 = dkf k2 .

If we write Ω̃ for the subset of {1, . . . , d2 } such that {ej , j ∈ Ω̃} is an enumeration of
{π(x, ξ)g, x ∈
/ S, ξ ∈ Ω}, then (4.20) may be rewritten as
X

kf k2 ≤
|hf, ej i|2

j∈Ω̃

As a consequence, we obtain that, if hf1 , ej i = hf2 , ej i for every j ∈ Ω̃, then applying this to
f = f1 − f2 , we obtain that f1 = f2 . It would thus be desirable to have an algorithm that
allows to reconstruct f from its frame coefficients {hf, ej i, j ∈ Ω̃}. In particular, we ask the
following:
Problem 1. Let {e1 , . . . , ed2 } be a Gabor frame in Cd . Assume that Ω̃ ⊂ {1, . . . , d2 } and
0 < δ < 1 are such that, for every f ∈ Cd ,
X
δdkf k2 ≤
|hf, ej i|2 .
j∈Ω̃

Is it true that every f in Cd is given by


d2

X
|hf˜, ej i| : hf˜, ej i = hf, ej i ∀j ∈ Ω̃ ?
f = argmin

ON UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLES IN THE FINITE DIMENSIONAL SETTING

Note that no sparsity is assumed on f here which make this problem differ from the one
considered by Pfander-Rauhut [29]. Also, we expect that there is a minimal δ0 > 0 such that
this property only holds for δ0 < δ < 1.
A slightly different problem that may arise in radar theory is that of recovering f and g
from partial knowledge of VgG f . It is totally unclear to us whether our results may contribute
to this task. In particular, note that this problem is quadratic (bilinear), so that an identity
such as (3.19)-(4.20) does not immediately imply that if VgG f = Vg̃G f˜ on S c × Ω, then g̃ = cg
and f˜ = cf with c ∈ C, |c| = 1.
