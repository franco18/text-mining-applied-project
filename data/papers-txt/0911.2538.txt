Abstract: This paper proposes a mathematical justification of the phenomenon
of extreme congestion at a very limited number of nodes in very large networks.
It is argued that this phenomenon occurs as a combination of the negative
curvature property of the network together with minimum length routing. More
specifically, it is shown that, in a large n-dimensional hyperbolic ball B of radius
R viewed as a roughly similar model of a Gromov hyperbolic network, the
proportion of traffic paths transiting through a small ball near the center
is

1
Θ(1), whereas, in a Euclidean ball, the same proportion scales as Θ Rn−1
. This
discrepancy persists for the traffic load, which at the center of the hyperbolic
1
ball scales as vol2 (B), whereas the same traffic load scales as vol1+ n (B) in the
Euclidean ball. This provides a theoretical justification of the experimental
exponent discrepancy observed by Narayan and Saniee between traffic loads
in Gromov-hyperbolic networks from the Rocketfuel data base and synthetic
Euclidean lattice networks. It is further conjectured that for networks that do
not enjoy the obvious symmetry of hyperbolic and Euclidean balls, the point of
maximum traffic is near the center of mass of the network.

Introduction

One of the most important challenges in large and wide area networks is to
overcome the traffic congestion problem. The queuing feature at routers can
create a logic bottleneck between two users. Correspondingly, insufficient bandwidth on the physical links between routers is a contributor to congestion. The
current congestion control technologies in communication networks are based
on the feedback from the congested node to the source to slow down the packet
flow rate, such as bidirectional congestion control and Random Early Detection
(RED). However, these technologies can only be applied once the congestion
has happened to some degree, and it is only based on the local point of view of
some queue overflow along the source-to-target path.
From the large scale point of view, it has been experimentally observed that,
on the Internet and other networks, traffic seems to concentrate quite heavily
on some very small subsets. The major result of this paper is to show that the
deeper reason behind this congestion in the large scale is the combination of the
least cost routing together with the negative curvature of the network.
Roughly speaking, a network is negatively curved if its graph can be approximated by a negatively curved Riemannian manifold. In practice, however, it
has become customary to check the Gromov Thin Triangle Condition (TTC),
meaning that the least cost paths between three vertices “arch inside” the triangle, giving it a “thin” external appearance. The connection between negatively
curved surfaces and the TTC can be understood on the basis that a triangle
drawn on a negatively curved surface has the sum of its internal angles < π,
giving it a “thin” appearance. The formalization of this equivalence is, however,
must harder and is known under the Bonk-Schramm theorem [3].
Over the past few years, there has been mounting evidence that many (wired
and wireless) communication networks are negatively curved [18, 11, 13, 12]. Hierarchical networks have been found to have “hidden hyperbolic structure” [17].
In view of the above graph-manifold identification, we can certainly argue on a
negatively curved n-dimensional Riemannian manifold. To simplify the exposition in this Introduction, we invoke the nontrivial fact, proved in the Appendix,
that congestion in very large hyperbolic ball models does not depend on the
dimension. Therefore, it is legitimate to argue on a negatively curved surface,
as we will do in the remainder of this Introduction.
A well-known feature of least length paths on a negatively curved surface
is the fact that two geodesics starting from points within an arbitrarily small
disk eventually diverge exponentially. In this paper, we somehow reverse that
argument and show that least length paths departing at remote points of a
convex subset X of the surface “converge” to a single point where the “density
of geodesics” is the highest. The latter is the point of maximum congestion. We
conjecture that this congestion point is near the center of mass of the convex
subset, and prove that the maximum congestion point and the center of mass
coincide for very large disks embedded in the surface.
Naturally, there might be some questions as to the relevance of this idealized
analysis to real networks. In fact, some recent experimental results [20] have
2

confirmed the validity of our analysis. The network congestion metric adopted
in [20] is the betweennness centrality [24]. The continuous geometry traffic
congestion metric adopted here is the average length of the geodesics in a small
convex subset X. We call the later load measure, Λt (X), because, if X is
thought as a sub-network, Λt (X) is meant to be the number of packets in that
sub-network. Consistently with the major theme of this paper, we prove that,
if X is a disk of fixed radius, Λt (X) is maximum when the disk has its center at
the center of mass. But more importantly, we show that, in a large disk BR (0)
of hyperbolic surface, maxX⊆BR (0),area(X)=1 Λt (X) scales as (area(BR (0)))2 . On
the other hand, it was shown in [20] that, for networks for the Rocketfuel data
base [22], the maximum betweennness centrality scales as N 2 , where N is the
number of vertices. Since N can be interpreted as the area, this confirms the
validity of our theoretical model.
An outline of the paper follows: In Section 2, we set the basic traffic metrics in graph models. In Section 3, a simple concept of negatively curved planar
graphs is introduced and the general facts about congestion in negatively curved
graphs are proposed as conjectures. Immediately thereafter, in Section 4, we
show that our conjectures hold in selected planar graph examples. In Section 5,
we propose the more general concept of Gromov-hyperbolic graphs and we invoke the Bonk-Schramm theorem to argue that traffic in Gromov-hyperbolic
graphs can be analyzed on negatively curved Riemannian manifold models. In
Section 6, we formulate our major results dealing with traffic in subsets of Hn .
Probably the most significant results are Theorems 3 and 2, proving that traffic in a small subset X of large hyperbolic and Euclidean balls BR (0) scale
as vol(BR (0))2 and vol(BR (0))1.5 , respectively. (The proofs are relegated to
the Appendix, though.) Theorem 4 and 5 formulate the basic minimum inertia versus maximum traffic issues, proving the conjectures for hyperbolic balls
X. Finally, in Section 7, we show that no matter how theoretical our models
are, they turn out to be surprisingly accurate at predicting asymptotic traffic
distribution in realistic networks.

Traffic metrics

Let G = (V, E) be a (connected) graph specified by its vertex set V and its edge
set E and endowed with a (symmetric) distance function d : G × G → R+ . A
path p(s, t) from s to t is a continuous map [0, l] → G such that p(s, t)(0) = s
and p(s, t)(l) = t. The weight of an edge e = xy
P is defined as w(e) = d(x, y).
The length of the path is defined as ℓ(p(s, t)) = e⊆p(s,t) w(e). A geodesic [s, t]
is a path such that ℓ ([s, t]) ≤ ℓ (p (s, t)), for all paths p(s, t) joining s to t.
The traffic on the graph is driven by a demand measure Λd : V × V → R+ ,
where the demand Λd (s, t) is the traffic rate (e.g., number of packets per second)
to be transmitted from the source s to the destination target t. Assume that
the routing protocol sends the packets from the source s to the target t along
the geodesic [s, t] with probability π ([s, t]). It is indeed customary as a load
balancing strategy to randomize the Dijkstra algorithm so as to distribute the
3

traffic more evenly [19, 5]. Under this scheme, the geodesic [s, t] inherits a
traffic rate measure τ ([s, t]) = Λd (s, t)π ([s, t]). An edge e laying on the path
[s, t] inherits from that path a traffic τ ([s, t]). Aggregating this traffic over all
source-target pairs and all geodesics traversing the edge e yields the traffic rate
sustained by the edge e,
X
X
X

Λd (s, t)π ([s, t]) .
τ ([s, t]) =
τ (e) =
(s,t)∈V ×V [s,t]⊇e

(s,t)∈V ×V [s,t]⊇e

Observe that τ (e)ℓ(e) can be interpreted as the traffic load, that is the number
of packets in the edge e.
This paper is essentially concerned with existence of a sub-network that has
extremely high traffic load. Formally, given a connected subgraph X ⊆ G,
containing some edges, we define its traffic load to be representative of the
number of packets in it:
P
ℓ(e)τ (e)
Λt (X) =

Pe∈X P
=
(1)
s,t∈V
e∈[s,t]∩X w(e) Λd (s, t)π ([s, t])
P
=
s,t∈V ℓ ([s, t] ∩ X) Λd (s, t)π ([s, t])
The above definition does not allow X to be reduced to a vertex, but we
can identify the smallest Λt -measurable neighbor of a vertex. Define the star of
a vertex, star(x), to be the smallest subgraph of G containing x; let ℓ(star(x))
be the sum of the lengths of set of edges abutting to x; the latter vertex set is
denoted as Ex = {xy : y ∈ V, xy ∈ E}. Then consider
P
X Λt (e)
X
Λt (e)
Λt (star(x))
≤
= Pe∈Ex
=
τ (e) =: τ (x)
ℓ (star(x))
ℓ(e)
e∈Ex ℓ(e)
e∈Ex

e∈Ex

The inequality is a well known fact, and equality is achieved for the number of
hops metric, that is, w(e) = 1, ∀e ∈ E. Since the traffic in any edge connected
to x must be “serviced” by the “hub” x, the interpretation of τ (x) is the traffic
rate sustained by x. Therefore, the fundamental question addressed by this
paper can be reformulated, from a very local point of view, as that of existence
of vertices with very high traffic rate. The above string indicates that such
vertices with very high traffic rates can be sought via the load measure Λt . The
latter aspect will play a crucial role in Section 6.
The traffic τ (x) can be computed by counting the number of geodesics [s, t]
having x as a vertex. One should consider two classes of such geodesics, though:
those that traverse x, that is, x 6= s, x 6= t, and those that either start at x,
[x, t], or terminate at x, [s, x]. The first ones have to be serviced twice, once
in the input queue, once in the output queue; the others have to be serviced
just once. There are 2(N − 1) geodesics starting or terminating at x. The
betweenness centrality βc of a vertex v is defined, for a uniquely geodesic
graph, as the number of geodesics that have v as a vertex (this includes those
geodesics starting at v or terminating at v). For uniformly defined demand,
4

that is, Λd (x, y) = 1, ∀x 6= y, the connection between the traffic rate and the
betweenness is easily seen to be
τ (v) = 2(βc (v) − 2(N − 1)) + 2(N − 1) = 2βc (v) − 2(N − 1)

3

Basic conjectures

For the sake of simplicity, we introduce a network curvature concept restricted
to planar communication graphs and based on Alexandrov angles [4].
Let (ab1 = abdeg(a)+1 , ab2 , ..., abdeg(a) ) be a cyclic ordering of the set of edges
attached to the vertex a. A geodesic triangle is defined as ∆abc = [a, b] ∪ [b, c] ∪
[c, a]. The Alexandrov angle αk at the vertex a of the geodesic triangle ∆abk bk+1
is
αk = cos−1

d(a, bk )2 + d(a, bk+1 )2 − d(bk , bk+1 )2
.
2d(a, bk )d(a, bk+1 )

Then the (Gauss) curvature at the vertex a is defined as
2π −

κ(a) = Pdeg(a)
k=1

Pdeg(a)
i=1

αk

area(∆abk bk+1 )

where area(∆abk bk+1 ) denotes the area of the geodesic triangle ∆abk bk+1 , easily
computable from the distances via Heron’s formula. It is easily seen that, for
the number of hops metric (w(e) = 1), we have αk = π/6; therefore, κ(a) < 0,
κ(a) = 0, or κ(a) > 0 depending on whether deg(a) > 6, deg(a) = 6, or
deg(a) < 6, respectively.
This simple definition is introduced to construct some easily understood
illustrative examples. In the main body of the paper, though, we will use the
Gromov definition of negative curvature for graphs (see Sec. 5.)
Definition 1 ([14]) The moment of inertia of a connected weighted graph
P
(2)
G with respect to a vertex v is defined as φG (v) = vi ∈V d2 (v, v i ).

Since the edges are treated as massless, this concept refers more to the underlying metric space structure (V, d) than to the weighted graph structure (V, E, d).
Observe that this inertia may be infinite.
Definition 2 ([14]) A center of mass or centroid of the weighted graph G
(2)
is defined as a vertex that achieves the infimum of the inertia: φG (cm(G)) =
(2)
inf v∈V φG (v) < ∞.
If the graph is infinite (|V | = ∞) , this definition requires existence of a vertex v
(2)
such that φG (v) < ∞. If we relax the minimum to be anywhere on the graph,
it will in general be achieved on an edge, but restricting it to vertices makes it
easier to relate it to the traffic.
We can now pose our conjectures.
5

Conjecture 1 (Negative curvature) Consider a large but finite (|V | < ∞)
negatively curved graph G, subject to uniformly distributed demand. Then
1. There are a very few nodes v that have very high traffic rate τ (v) as measured by βc (v); furthermore, the vertices of highest traffic rate are in a
small neighborhood of the vertices of minimum inertia.
2. If the graph has a symmetry group that fixes some point 0, this point
achieves the unique minimum of the inertia and the maximum of the traffic
rate.
The first part of this conjecture is illustrated on planar graphs in Section 4. As
a model of a large negatively curved graph, it is tempting to take the full hyperbolic space Hn . The latter is (globally) affine symmetric [8, Chap. IV], [15,
Sec. 6.2], [16, Chap. XI, Example 10.2], and the transitivity of the symmetry
group [16, XI, Th. 1.4] would make the traffic uniformly distributed, if it weren’t
for the lack of convergence of the traffic function for uniformly distributed demand on infinite space. Restricting the network model to finite subsets of Hn
breaks enough of the symmetry to create traffic spikes, even asymptotically as
the size increases to infinity. An estimate of how close the center of mass and
the point of maximum traffic is seems to be beyond our reach for general network models, at least at this stage. However, for hyperbolic balls, we prove that
the two coincide and, as major result, that the sharpest traffic spike scales as
vol(G)2 .
Conjecture 2 (Nonnegative curvature) Consider a large but finite (|V | <
∞) nonnegatively curved graph G subject to uniformly distributed demand. Then
1. Both the traffic and inertia functions τ and βc are more evenly distributed
than in the case of a negatively curved graph.
2. If the graph has a vertex transitive symmetry group, then both the traffic
and the inertia are uniform.
Even though this conjecture asserts that for both zero curvature graphs (e.g.,
Euclidean lattices) and positively curved graphs, the traffic is more smoothly
distributed than in the case of negatively curved graphs, there is a significant
difference between the two cases. A Euclidean lattice graph could be infinite,
while positively curved (cubic) graphs are finite by Higuchi’s theorem [9, 23,
21, 6]. Positively curved graphs need not be truncated and hence enjoy more
symmetry than truncated Euclidean or hyperbolic graphs. This point is easy to
illustrate on the 1-skeleta of the boundaries of the Platonic solids, all of which
are positively curved. (For those Platonic solids that have triangular faces, the
above curvature formula applies; for the other Platonic solids, the more general
Higuchi-Mohar-DeVos formula [6] should be applied.) The transitivity of the
symmetry groups of the Platonic solids, together with the uniform distribution
of the demand, implies the uniform distribution of the traffic on the boundary
graphs. For more general positively curved graphs, this conjecture is proved
6

using a Riemannian manifold model with its curvature bounded as 0 < k12 ≤
κ(x) ≤ k22 . Here the symmetry is broken by the nonisotropic curvature
Truncating En to secure convergence results in symmetry breaking, creating
traffic “bumps,” not as sharp as those of the negatively curved case, but sharper
than those in the positively curved spaces. This statement is quantified by
1
showing that the maximum traffic scales as vol(G)1+ n .

Some examples

We consider two simple examples: The first one (symmetric graph) highlights
the worsening of the congestion as the curvature decreases. The second one
(asymmetric graph) highlights the relationship between the curvature and the
inertia.

4.1

Almost symmetric graph: congestion versus curvature

We construct a graph from a single vertex (#1) followed by the addition of seven
neighbors (#2-#8) in a counterclockwise sense, as shown in Figure 1, top. We
then proceed from vertex #2 and add vertices #9, #10, #11, #12, so that
vertex #2 has valence 7. We then add neighbors to vertex #3, and proceed
recursively, until we obtain the graph shown in Figure 1, top. With 7 neighbors
for each
P7vertex, except the boundary ones, the graph is negatively curved, because i=1 αi = 7 × π3 > 2π. The same construction can be done to generate
graphs of valence 6 (vanishing curvature) and 8 (negative curvature). The plots
of Figure 1, bottom, clearly demonstrate that the maximum congestion worsens
as the curvature becomes more negative.

4.2

Asymmetric graph: congestion versus inertia

Here we consider a graph of valence 7, constructed the same way as in the
preceding case, except that some “appendices” have been deliberately added
to make the graph asymmetric. The results are shown in Figure 2. Because
the graph is negatively curved, and as conjectured, the traffic has its maximum
precisely at the point where the inertia is minimum. Observe that the traffic
and the inertia are “in opposite phase.”

5

From graphs to Riemannian manifolds

As said in the Introduction, it has become standard routine in complex networks
to check their Gromov negatively curved property as a way to validate arguments based on such models as the Poincaré disk. For the sake of mathematical
accuracy, we formulate the basic definition and result.

7

Figure 1: Top: Almost symmetric negatively curved network of valence 7. Bottom: Traffic function τ versus vertex number; clearly, congestion at centroid
increases as curvature becomes more negative. Also shown is the traffic function after curvature-based load balancing (see [19] for details).
Definition 3 A geodesic metric space (G, dG ), for example a graph, is said to
be Gromov hyperbolic if there exists a δ < ∞ such that every geodesic triangles △abc has an inscribed triangle △xyz, x ∈ [b, c], y ∈ [a, c], z ∈ [a, b], of a
perimeter not exceeding δ, that is, d(x, y) + d(y, z) + d(z, x) ≤ δ.
This definition makes sense only for infinite graphs. Even though there exists a
Gromov concept for finite graphs [11], we really do not need the latter here, as
our congestion analysis is asymptotic for very large graphs (or manifolds).
Theorem 1 (Bonk-Schramm [3]) Let (G, dG ) be a Gromov hyperbolic metric geodesic space with bounded growth at some scale. There exist an integer n,
a convex subset D ⊆ Hn , constants λ, k, and a map f : G → D such that
|λdG (u, v) − dD (f (u), f (v))| ≤ k,
and supx∈D dD (x, f (G)) ≤ k.
8

∀u, v ∈ G

Figure 2: Traffic and inertia versus vertex number on a planar graph of valence
7; the graph has been made asymmetric so that the conjecture could be verified
on cases where the centroid does not coincide with the obvious symmetry center.
The centroid occurs at vertex #14. Also observe the heavy traffic at vertex #4,
because it is the gateway between the top appendix and the right side of the
network. Observe the “opposite phase” phenomenon between the inertia and
the traffic, clearly seen for vertex #86.
This theorem makes precise the somewhat loose statement made in the introduction regarding graph-manifold identification. Clearly, G, after a scaling λ,
can be identified with D via f and subject to a bounded error k. The condition
of bounded growth at some scale is satisfied, for example, when G is a finite
valence graph.
Since this graph-manifold identification entails a bounded error, large scale
problems on graphs can be mapped to more manageable continuous geometry
problems on manifolds.

Differential geometry proof of conjectures

To justify our numerical results related to congestion on planar graphs of uniform valence of 7, 8, 9, we could develop a Poincaré disk model (see Fig. 3,
right panel). The latter is a faithful model in the sense that the graphs of valence 7, 8, 9 are quasi-isometric to the Poincaré disk. Recall that the Poincaré
disk D = {z = x + jy ∈ C : |z| < 1} inherits its hyperbolic structure through the
metric ds2 = 4dzdz̄2 2 . The latter leads to the area element darea = 4dxdy2 2 .
(1−|z| )
(1−|z| )
In the spirit of generalization, we develop models in the hyperbolic space Hn ,
even in a Riemannian manifold M with arbitrary Riemannian metric ds2 and
volume form dvol, provided its sectional curvature bounded as −k22 ≤ κ(x) ≤
−k12 < 0. To emphasize the role of the curvature, we also look at the Euclidean
space E2 as a model of graphs of valence 6 and further generalize the results to
En .

6.1

Hyperbolic versus Euclidean traffic load

Consider, in a Riemannian manifold M , a large ball BR (0) of radius R with
its center at the origin together with a convex subset X ⊂ BR (0). The traffic
load in X is defined as (compare with (1))
ZZ
Λt (X) =
ℓ (X ∩ [s, t]) dΛd (s, t)
(s,t)∈BR (0)×BR (0)

As for the graph model, in this Riemannian context, the demand is uniformly
distributed in the sense that dΛd (s, t) is the product volume dvol(s)dvol(t). The
normalized traffic load in X is defined as follows:
λt (X) :=
=

Λt (X)
vol(BR (0))2
1
vol(BR (0))2

RR

(s,t)∈BR (0)×BR (0)

ℓ (X ∩ [s, t]) dΛd (s, t)

(2)

We take the hyperbolic plane H2 as a roughly similar model of an infinite
negatively curved planar graph [9] and carry over the analysis to n dimensions.
In order to secure convergence of the traffic load, we restrict ourselves to the
finite domain BR (0) ⊂ Hn , representative of a large but finite negatively curved
graph G, and then we do the asymptotic analysis as R → ∞.
We now state our two major results. The proofs are in the Appendix:
Theorem 2 If BR (0) and X = Br (0), r ≪ R, are concentric balls in Hn and
if dΛd (s, t) is the product volume measure, we have
λt (Br (0)) ≍ c1 (n)rn
where ck (n) > 0. Furthermore, in a Riemannian manifold of curvature bounded
as −k22 ≤ κ(x) ≤ −k12 < 0, ∀x ∈ M , the asymptotic traffic load is bounded as
ck1 (n)rn ≤ λt (X) ≤ ck2 (n)rn .

Figure 3: Traffic load in Euclidean space and Poincaré disk, the latter taken as
a model of H2 . The radii of the balls in the complex plane model are written
r̄, R̄ and the corresponding hyperbolic measurements are r = tanh−1 (r̄), R =
tanh−1 (R̄).
Theorem 3 If BR (0) and X = Br (0), r ≪ R, are n-dimensional Euclidean
balls (vanishing curvature) and if dΛd (s, t) is the product volume measure, we
have
rn
λt (Br (0)) ≍ c0 (n) n−1
R
for some constant c0 (n) > 0, independent of r, R.
Probably the most important conclusion to be drawn from the preceding
two theorems is that the normalized traffic load in the small hyperbolic ball
Br (0) remains bounded from below as R → ∞, whereas the same normalized
traffic but in the small Euclidean ball goes to zero as R → ∞. Figure 3 provides an intuitive explanation as to why this discrepancy happens. Because the
hyperbolic geodesics are “arched” towards the center where the small ball lies,
their average length in the small hyperbolic ball is much larger than in the small
Euclidean ball.
Figure 3 gives a clue about elementary proofs of Theorems 3-2 in 2 dimensions. Clearly, the natural parameterization of the s(x, y), t(x′ , y ′ ) points in
the traffic load integral is via polar coordinates; the difficulty is to compute the
′
dy ′
Jacobian from dxdydx′ dy ′ , (1−(x2 +ydxdydx
2 ))2 (1−(x′2 +y ′2 ))2 , resp., to the area squared
element in polar coordinates of Euclidean, hyperbolic, resp., spaces. The details are available in [19]; this elementary but more explicit proof yields a specific
value for c0 (2) = 1/π. The proof in the appendix is much more conceptual.
Observe that, besides its definition as the traffic load, λt could be interpreted

11

in another way. Instead of (2), consider the following:
ZZ
1
IX∩[s,t] (s, t)dΛd (s, t)
vol(BR (0))2
BR (0)×BR (0)
where IX∩[s,t] (s, t) = 1 if X ∩ [s, t] 6= ∅ and 0 otherwise. The above is clearly
the proportion of communication paths transiting through X. If X is between
two balls, that is, Br1 (0) ⊆ X ⊆ Br2 (0), the above is of the order of λt (X)/ri .
Thus λt (X) can be interpreted as the percentage of traffic passing through X.

6.2

Minimum inertia

Let D ⊂ M be a convex domain of finite volume in a Riemannian manifold with
distance d(·, ·). For x ∈ D, define (compare with Def. 1)
Z
(p)
d(x, x′ )p dvol(x′ )
φ (x) =
D

For p = 2, the above is called moment of inertia of D relative to x. Next,
assume there exists a point cm(D) ∈ D such that (compare with Def. 2)
φ(p) (cm(D)) = inf φ(p) (x) < ∞
x∈D

For p = 2, cm(D) is called a center of mass or centroid of D (see [14, Def.
3.2.1]). This concept was apparently introduced by Elie Cartan [2, p. 47].
Arguments related to existence and uniqueness of the center of mass rely on
strict convexity of x 7→ d(x, y)p and x 7→ φ(p) (x). In negatively curved spaces,
p ≥ 1 suffices, whereas in nonpositively curved spaces (e.g., Euclidean spaces)
the stricter condition p > 1 is required. If φ(p) is strictly convex, uniqueness is
guaranteed [14, Lemma 3.1.1].
Theorem 4 Let M be a complete Riemannian manifold with its curvature
bounded as −k22 ≤ κ(x) ≤ −k12 < 0. Then the inertia of BR (0) ⊂ M relative to the point x,
Z
(2)
d(x, x′ )2 dvol(x′ )
φ (x) =
BR (0)

has a unique minimum; furthermore, for k1 = k2 , this minimum is x = 0.
Proof. Obviously, M is a complete Riemannian manifold of nonpositive curvature, and hence it is a Busemann Non Positively Curved (NPC) space [14,
page 45]. Define the measure µ(·) = vol(·)IBR (0) (·), where IBR (0) denotes the
indicator of BR (0) ⊂ M . Obviously, the measure µ has finite support and
µ(BR (0)) < ∞. Therefore, by [14, Th. 3.2.1],
Z

′ 2
′

is finite and has a unique infimum. Furthermore, if k1 = k2 = 1, M has
orientation preserving isometry group SO+ (n, 1). Under the subgroup that fixes
0, BR (0) is invariant, and therefore φ(2) has the same symmetries. Therefore,
the only way to secure uniqueness of the infimum is x∗ = 0.

6.3

Maximum load

Theorem 5 Restricted to convex subsets X of BR (0) ⊂ Hn with the same
hyperbolic area, λt (X) reaches its maximum for a ball centered at the origin of
BR (0).
Proof. The proof is a corollary of the proof of the Appendix. First, observe
that µk (x) is spherically invariant, that is, µk (x) = µk (Sx), ∀S in the subgroup
of SO+ (n, 1) that fixes 0. Write µk (|x|) to be the common value of µ(x) when
x ∈ ∂B|x|(0).
Next, we want to prove that

Thus µk (|x|) reaches its maximum at x = 0. Furthermore, it is obviously symmetric for the subgroup of SO+ (n, 1) that fixes 0. Finally, from the Appendix,
µk (||x||) is monotone decreasing with ||x||.
13

It remains to show that the optimal way to distribute the volume allocated
to X is in a ball around 0. First, we show that, if inf λt (X) is achieved for
some X ∗ that does not enjoy the symmetry under the action of the subgroup
of SO+ (n, 1) that fixes 0, then the same λt (X ∗ ) can be achieved for another
subset, that has the symmetry, but that cannot be optimal.
Decompose the big ball as BR (0) = ⊔m−1
i=0 A[ri , ri+1 ), where A[ri , ri+1 ) is the
annulus {x : ri ≤ d(0, x) < ri+1 }. Clearly, there exists an annulus A[ρP
i , ρi+ ) ⊆
A[ri , ri+1 ) such that λt (X∩A[ri , ri+1 )) = λt (A[ρi , ρi+ )). Thus λt (X) = i λt (A[ρi , ρi+ ))
and
X Z ρi+
µk (r)T (r)dr
λt (X) =

where T (r) is the transverse measure such that vol(A[r, r + dr)) = T (r)dr,
that is, T (r) is the “area” of the sphere at 0 with radius r. Consider now the

Again, a Lagrange multiplier argument proves that optimality could not hold
with some i such that ρi+ < ρi+1 . (The intuition is that, since the density µk
is monotone decreasing, optimality would require ρi+1 to drop down to ρi+ .)
Thus ρ0 = 0 and ρi+ = ρi+1 , that is, the presumed optimal annulus collapses
to a ball. 

Differential geometry versus real network congestion

It is argued that, no matter how theoretical our model Λt (Br (0)) of the traffic
load is, it is remarkably accurate at predicting how the “load at the center,”
here 0, scales with the number of vertices, N , in a real network.
In [20], the traffic load at the “center” of a sample of networks from the
Rocketfuel data base [22] has been numerically found to scale as N 2 . Using the
scaled Gromov analysis [11], it was asserted in [20] that the networks from that
data base are negatively curved. In [20], the “center” is somewhat loosely defined
as the “network core,” or the “set of nodes that are at the intersection of the
majority of geodesics.” The latter intuitive concept is unmistakably the same
as our theoretical center of mass concept. In the same paper [20], Narayan and
Saniee provide experimental evidence that the traffic load at the center of WattsStrogatz Small-World 2-dimensional networks scales as N 1.5 . It is commonly
admitted, and it has been proved using the scaled Gromov δ-analysis [11], that
those networks are not hyperbolic; they are rather Euclidean, even positively
14

curved, in a certain range of the connectivity and rewiring parameters [18, Sec.
6.4.2].
Fact 1 (Narayan and Saniee [20]) Let βc (v) be the betweenness centrality
of the vertex v in a network.
1. In the Rocketfuel data base [22] of real networks, which are scaled-Gromov
hyperbolic by the definition of [11], the maximum traffic rate scales as
max βc (v) = Θ(N 2 )
v

2. For synthetic 2-dimensional Euclidean lattice networks, the maximum traffic rate scales as
max βc (v) = Θ(N 1.5 )
v

To proceed to a continuous geometry justification of the above, the graphs
are embedded in appropriate manifolds, using the Bonk-Schramm theorem for a
Gromov hyperbolic graph, or using the trivial Euclidean embedding for the Euclidean lattice graphs. The Bonk-Schramm embedding f : G → D ⊆ Hn maps
the geodesic flow on the graph G to a quasi-geodesic flow on the manifold D.
Consider a vertex v on the graph. We clearly have Λt (star(v)) ≈ Λt (Br (f (v))),
for some r of the order of the mesh of the graph. But as argued in Section 2,
Λt (star(v)) scales as τ (v), which scales as βc (v). The continuous geometry model
of the traffic metric of the above Fact is therefore Λt (Br (x)) for some x ∈ D.
Obviously, the continuous geometry equivalent of N is
N = vol(D)
Fact 2 (Theorems 2 and 3) Let Λt (Br (x)) be the traffic load in a small metric ball Br (x) embedded in a large metric ball BR (0), where R ≫ r.
• In a hyperbolic ball BR (0) ⊂ Hn , we have
max Λt (Br (x)) = Θ(vol(BR (0))2 ) = Θ(N 2 )

• In a Euclidean ball BR (0) ⊂ En , we have

R
In view of the striking consistency between Fact 1 and Fact 2, our model
correctly predicts how the maximum traffic load scales as a function of N or the
volume of the manifold.
By the same token, we have extended the Euclidean results of [20] to the case
where n > 2. This generalization allows us to observe that, as the dimension
gets higher and higher, the Euclidean congestion decreases and the gap between
traffic loads in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces increases.
While there are computational methods to check the Gromov property of
a network [11, 18, 1, 10], associating a dimension with a complex network is
an entirely other matter. The remarkable feature is that the asymptotic traffic
analysis in negatively curved spaces transcends the dimension.

The case of positive curvature

The case of a Riemannian manifold positively curved as 0 < k12 < κ < k22 is
significantly different from that of a nonpositively curved manifold, because the
diameter of the former is bounded as π/k1 . Furthermore, by the sphere theorem [7, Chap. 13], if k1 = k2 /2, the manifold is homeomorphic to a sphere.
Thus, contrary to the nonpositive curvature case, we cannot take a very large
manifold with fixed positive curvature; so, we will have to take an arbitrarily
large manifold of positive curvature decreasing to 0. The first part of the following theorem is completely trivial; the second part is easily proved by bounding
the integrand of (4) and taking the upper limit of the two inner integrals to be
πR = π/k.
Theorem 6 Let M be a connected n-dimensional Riemannian manifold with
constant curvature κ = k 2 > 0.
1. Both the normalized traffic λt and the inertia φ(2) over the whole manifold
are uniform.


, where BπR (0) = M \ {antipodal point of 0}.
2. λt (Br (0)) = Θ R2n−2

Comparing with Theorem 3, it is clear that the normalized traffic decays with
n even faster than in the Euclidean case.
Finally, using the comparison formula of the Appendix, the following is easily
derived:
Theorem 7 Let M be a connected Riemannian manifold with curvature bounded
as k12 < κ ≤ k22 . Then
µ+
k2 (x) <

dλt (x)
≤ µ+
k1 (x)
dx

Thus, under varying but bounded curvature, the traffic density in a small neighborhood of x remains bounded between the densities in fixed curvature. (Observe that by symmetry µ+
ki (x), i = 1, 2, are independent of x.)

9

Conclusion

We have provided a mathematical justification of the experimentally observed
fact that negatively curved networks—even with uniform curvature—driven by
uniformly distributed demand have small areas of very high traffic concentration. Nonnegatively curved networks, on the other hand, do not exhibit this
phenomenon as dramatically as negatively curved networks. In fact, uniformly
positively curved networks have uniform traffic distribution; more generally,
bounds on the curvature implies bounds on the maximum traffic.
Since the root cause of congestion in a network is its negative curvature, load
balancing could be achieved by controlling the curvature to become and remain
positive [19], despite outages and varying demand.
16

The areas of maximum traffic have been narrowed down to areas of low inertia. It has been proved that networks with enough symmetry have colocated
maximum traffic and minimum inertia. But as already said, for general networks, bounding the distance between the two points is a challenging problem.
The traffic dealt with here is the one driven by a uniformly distributed demand. The extension to nonuniformly distributed demand isnot a major hurdle.

It suffices to redefine the inertia as φG (v) = vi d2 (v, v i )
j Λd (v , v ) .
Finally, the present analysis is a spatial one. The temporal component would
bring the dynamics of packet drops and retransmission into the picture. Early
ns-2 simulation have shown that UDP traffic has its maximum packet drop at
the point of maximum traffic/minimum inertia [19].

Appendix: Nonpositively curved spaces

Let D be a convex domain in an n–dimensional Riemannian manifold M . Here
convex means that, for every s and t in D, there is a unique shortest geodesic,
or shortest path, [s, t] going from s to t and contained in D.
For a subset X of D, we are interested in
Z
1
λt (X) =
ℓ(X ∩ [s, t]) ds dt
vol(D)2 D×D
where the integral is with respect to the square power of the n–dimensional
volume of D.
From a dynamical point of view, assuming uniform traffic between pairs of
points of D, and assuming that this traffic travels at unit speed along geodesics,
λt (X) measures the average of the amount of time spent in X.
We provide an estimate for λt (X) when M has non-positive curvature, and
an exact computation when the curvature is constant.
Consider a point s in D. For every unit vector ~v based at s, draw the
geodesic g~v emanating from s in the direction of ~v , and let e(~v ) be the distance
from s to the point where the geodesic exits D. (This exit point is unique by
convexity of D.) We can similarly consider the geodesic g−~v emanating from s
in the opposite direction −~v , and the corresponding distance e(−~v ).
For k > 0, define

In other words, the quantity λt (X) is estimated by the integral of the density
functions µk .
Proof. Let T be the set of triples (s, t, x) where s, t, x are points of D such
that x is located on the geodesic [s, t] and inside of X. There are two natural
measures that can be put on T .
The first one is the product ds dt dℓ of the volume in s, the volume in t,
and the arc length parameter ℓ along the geodesic [s, t]. The reason why we are
considering T with this measure is that
Z
Z
ℓ(X ∩ [s, t]) ds dt =

D×D

The second one requires a different description of T . If we consider the unit
vector ~v based at x and pointing in the direction of s (so that −~v points in the
direction of t), the distance s from x to s, and the distance t from x to t, then
the three points (s, t, x) are completely determined by the x-based vector ~v and
by the numbers s and t ≥ 0.
Recall that the unit tangent bundle T 1 X consists of all unit vectors ~v based
at points of X. This is a (2n − 1)–dimensional manifold (n dimensions for the
base point, n − 1 for the direction), and the metric of X naturally lifts to a
Riemannian metric on T 1 X by using the Levi-Civita connection.
The above construction identifies the set T of triples (s, t, x) with x ∈ X ∩
[s, t] to the subset of T 1 X × R × R consisting of those (v, s, t) where v is a
point of T 1 X, and where 0 ≤ s ≤ e(~v ) and 0 ≤ t ≤ e(−~v), with e(~v ) the
distance between x and the point e(~v ) where the geodesic starting at x along
the direction ~v exits D (see Fig. 3, right panel). Considering the volume form
dv on T 1 X now provides another measure dv ds dt on T .
When the curvature of M is bounded between −k12 and −k22 , the two measures ds dt dℓ and dv ds dt on T can be compared by the standard Riemannian
arguments on the variation of geodesics (using Jacobi fields):
Lemma 1

Observe that, on the fourth line, d~v stands for the (n−1)–dimensional volume on

dimensional volume of T 1 X in the two lines before.
The inequality
Z
µk1 (x) dx
λt (X) ≥
X

is proved by the same argument. 
For instance, consider the case where D and X are two concentric balls in
a n-manifold of constant curvature −k 2 ≤ 0, of respective radii R and r with
r << R. Then, e(~v ) ≍ R for every vector ~v based at a point of X.
Theorem 9 If D and X are two concentric balls of respective radii R and r,
with r << R, in the Euclidean space of dimension n, then the proportion λt (X)
of traffic in D that transits through X is approximately
λt (X) ≍ c0 (n)

rn
.
Rn−1

where c0 (n) is an explicit constant depending on the dimension n.
If, instead, D and X are concentric balls in the n–dimensional hyperbolic
space (where the curvature is −1), then
λt (X) ≍ c1 (n)rn .
Proof. Under these hypotheses, λt (X) is of the order of µk (0)vol(X). Write
µk (0) = Mk (0)/vol(D)2 , where Mk (0) is the triple integral. e(~v ) ≍ R for every
vector ~v based at a point of X. Therefore, in the Euclidean case, M0 (0) is of
the order of Rn+1 , vol(D) is of the order of Rn , and λt (X) is of the order of
rn /Rn−1 . In the hyperbolic case, M1 (0) is of the order of e2(n−1)R , vol(D) is of
the order of e(n−1)R , and thus λt (X) is of the order of vol(X), which is itself of
the order of rn for r small. 
Note the independence on R in the negatively curved case.
Proof of Lemma: The Jacobi field equation [7] in the hyperplane orthogonal
to the geodesic [x, e(~v )] in the n-manifold M of constant curvature −k 2 reads

− k 2 J(s) = 0. If dxi = J(0), i = 1, ..., n − 1, is a linear element orthogonal

the solution to the Jacobi field equation at s reads, with a similar solution for
[x, e(−~v )] at t,

Observe that, to go from the second to the third line, we need skew-commutativity
of ∧ along with some elementary hyperbolic trigonometry. The inequality follows from the Rauch comparison argument [16, VIII, Th. 4.1], which in this
context refers to the monotone increasing property of the solution shk (x) to the
Jacobi field equation with k. 
We finish this Appendix with two corollaries, useful in the main body of the
text. A notation needs to be made more explicit: ex (~v ) denotes the length of
the geodesic shot from x in the direction ~v and terminating at ∂BR (0).
Corollary 1 For fixed ~v , ex (~v ) + ex (−~v ) is strictly monotone decreasing with
||x||.
Proof. Let ex (~v ) be the point where the geodesic starting at x with direction
~v exits BR (0). With a mild abuse of notation, we will let ~v denote the angle
between the radial [0, x] and the tangent to the geodesic at x. Same definition applies to ex (−~v ). Because Hn is isotropic, the geodesic [ex (−~v ), ex (~v )]
is contained in a plane, which itself contains x and 0. Let [0,p] be the radial
orthogonal to that geodesic. In the right angle triangle, △0pex (~v )), we get
20


cosh R
cosh 21 ||ex (~v )ex (−~v ))|| = cosh(||0p||)
. On the other hand, in the right angle
triangle △xp0, we have sinh ||0p|| = cosh(x) sin ~v . It follows that



and from there the result is obvious. 

Corollary 2 For k > 0, the density function µk (s) is strictly monotone decreasing with ||s||.
Proof. It is easily seen that the double inner integral in the definition (3) of µk
is a polynomial in the variables exp(±ki(es (~v ) + es (−~v )), where i is some power.
From the same definition, it is also obvious that the inner double integral is
monotone increasing with es (~v ) + es (−~v ). But, by the previous corollary, the
latter is monotone decreasing with ||s||. Thus the double inner integral in (3) is
monotone decreasing with ||s||, and so is the average over the sphere Ssn−1 . 
