Abstract
We consider five different peer-to-peer file sharing systems with two chunks, with the aim
of finding chunk selection algorithms that have provably stable performance with any input
rate and assuming non-altruistic peers who leave the system immediately after downloading
the second chunk. We show that many algorithms that first looked promising lead to unstable
or oscillating behavior. However, we end up with a system with desirable properties. Most of
our rigorous results concern the corresponding deterministic large system limits, but in two
simplest cases we provide proofs for the stochastic systems also.

Introduction

We consider an open network, with constant rate of incoming ’peers’. A peer is assumed to be able
to contact and communicate with any other peer in the system (technically, this can be realised by
an overlay network built upon the Internet, where the knowledge of a peer’s IP-address enables
communication with it). We assume that one special, persistent peer, the ’seed’, holds a file and
wishes to distribute it to all the others. The most effective way of doing this, in particular when
the number of peers is very large, is that as soon as a peer receives the file, it becomes a seed
itself. The number of copies of the file then grow exponentially. To enhance performance, the file
is divided into small chunks that are spread in similar fashion so that parts of the file may start to
be multiplied before the original seed has even once uploaded the whole file. This technique was
introduced by B. Cohen with his BitTorrent [1] protocol. It became soon the dominant principle
of sharing large files (e.g., movies) with peer-to-peer networking.
Moreover, the peers can be ’non-altruistic’ in the sense that they leave the system immediately
having downloaded the whole file, without necessarily slowing the system performance. It is
remarkable that if there are more than one chunks, it seems that any arrival rate of new peers can
still be sustained. However, as we shall see, some additional algorithms are then needed for stable
performance. This paper analyses several such algorithms in the simplest relevant case of two
1

chunks. In real systems the number of chunks is large, e.g. of the order 103 . However, even the
case of two chunks, considered here, is highly non-trivial. In fact, it may also be the hardest case
as regards stability. For proving stability it is anyway the easiest case, and hopefully the solutions
for the two chunk case appear useful in more general models as well.
We work on a fully distributed scenario, relying on randomness: each peer contacts another,
uniformly randomly chosen peer, according to a standard Poisson process, and gets to know what
chunks the latter possesses. What follows, depends on the particular algorithm. Massoulie and
Vojnovic [7] were the first to propose this model and to obtain rigorous mathematical results on it.
They allowed an arbitrary number of chunks and analysed the corresponding deterministic large
system limit (see Section 2) with the following remarkable result: if each new peer arriving in the
system obtains a roughly uniformly random chunk, the system is stable even if all the remaining
chunks are downloaded randomly. (In the special case of two chunks, it is noted in [7] that the
scheme does not give a unique rest point in the large system limit, but for any larger number of
chunks it does.) However, the results of [7] prompt for further research in at least two directions.
First, the scheme where the seed gives a uniformly distributed chunk to every new peer makes the
seed a potential bottleneck — thus, this algorithm is not as fully distributed as it could be. Second,
the stability of the large system limit does not automatically guarantee the stability of the original
random system.
We focus on entirely distributed solutions, where also the first chunk must be found randomly
from the peer population, and assume ’non-altruistic’ peers. In our first paper [8] we considered
the so-called flash-crowd scenario where a large number of peers arrive simultaneously but none
afterwards. It was noticed that the first phase of the copying process is asymptotically (with
increasing number of peers) equivalent to Pólya’s urn model, which is well known to converge
to a random proportion of each chunk in the system. This imbalance leads to the ’rare chunk
phenomenon’: one of the chunks is not able to become common and as a result forms a bottleneck
of performance (see also [10]). In an open variant of this setup, with continuously incoming
peers, this could lead to instability: the number of peers in the system could grow unboundedly,
since more and more peers would be searching for the one rare chunk. (BitTorrent counteracts
to the rare chunk phenomenon by its ’Rarest First’ principle, and our last two algorithms can
be seen as distributed ways to implement this principle using very coarse rarity estimates.) The
central question of this paper is: is it possible to avoid the severely imbalanced chunk distribution,
implying instability, without using centralized coordination of downloads?
One source of ideas for this is provided by the wide literature on urn models (originally often
related to physics; for a recent review, see [9]). For example, Ehrenfests’ urn model gives an
almost ideal balance in a closed system. Still more relevant is the so-called Friedman urn, with
an analogous result for an open system, with a flow of incoming particles. We showed in [8] that
if an empty node first contacts a node having chunk 0 (1) but then downloads the opposite chunk
1 (0) first (neglecting for a while the question how a peer with that chunk could be found), the
distribution of chunks converges almost surely to 21 − 12 as the number of peers goes to infinity.
In this paper, we analyse five two-chunk models: (i) the Plain Random Contact system, which is
found to be very unstable; (ii) the Deterministic First Chunk system, proposed in [8], but found
unstable in the present scenario; (iii) the ideal Friedman system (non-implementable in a dis-

2

tributed way in our scenario), which is proven to be stable; and two distributed algorithms that
try to approximate the Friedman system: (iv) the Delayed Friedman system, which may be stable
but oscillates heavily, and, finally, (v) the Enforced Friedman system which seems to provide the
desired performance.
The paper is structured as follows: general definitions and some preliminaries are given in Section
2, and the five models are studied in Section 3, each in its own subsection. Some concluding
remarks are made in Section 4.

Definitions and preliminaries

We study time-homogeneous continuous time Markov processes S = (St )t≥0 with state space
Nd , where d is 2,3 or 4, depending on the particular model. Denoting the ith unit vector by ei ,
i = 1, . . . , d, the transitions are always of one of the three forms
s → s + ei ,

s → s − ei ,

s → s + ei − ej .

Denote the transition intensity from state m to state n by q(m, n). The process S is thought as
a model of a queueing network, where the state component i presents the number of customers in
network node i, i = 1, . . . , d.
The Markov process S is called stable, if it is irreducible and positively recurrent. This is equivalent to the existence of a unique stationary probability measure. Assuming irreducibility and
finiteness of transition graph neighborhoods, stability is equivalent to the existence of a finite set
of states C ⊂ Nd such that with any starting point S0 , the process reaches C in a time with finite
expectation.
Let F : (0, ∞)d → Rd be a Lipschitz continuous function so that the autonomous ordinary
differential equation
ṡ = F (s)
(1)
has a solution s(t), t ∈ [0, T ), T ∈ (0, ∞], for every starting point s(0) ∈ (0, ∞)d . We say that
the dynamical system (1) is the large system limit of the Markov process S, if



vi q(bN xc, bN xc + v) , i = 1, . . . , d,
Fi (x) = lim q(bN xc, bN xc + ei ) +
N →∞
N
v6∈{e1 ,...,ed }

where byc denotes the largest integer less than or equal to y and is defined componentwise for
vectors, and v = (v1 , . . . , vd ) runs over the different possible transition vectors. The idea is to
scale the arrival rates to the system (transitions v = ei ) as well as the states by N , divide by
N and take the limit. Thus, we assume the internal transition and exit rates to be linear in N
as functions of the state. Conditions of limit theorems showing the convergence of the Markov
process towards a deterministic limit system in such scaling have been established by Kurtz [5].
This type of results, however, tell nothing about the stability of a stochastic system with finite N ,
and therefore we don’t review them closer here.
3

The dynamical system (1) is called locally asymptotically stable around an equilibrium state s∗
(that is, a state with F (s∗ ) = 0), if there exists an open set U containing s∗ such that limt→∞ s(t) =
s∗ for any initial state s(0) ∈ U . The system is called globally asymptotically stable, if it has a
unique equilibrium state s∗ , such that limt→∞ s(t) = s∗ for any initial state s(0) ∈ (0, ∞)d .
Finally, we call the system (1) (globally) stable, if there is a compact set K ⊂ (0, ∞)d such that
for any initial state s(0) ∈ (0, ∞)d the system reaches K and eventually stays in K.
The stability of a large system limit is not known to be sufficient nor necessary for the stability of
the original Markov process. We are not aware of any rigorous results concerning this question,
but the following remarks illuminate the difficulties in relating the two notions. First, assume that
the large system limit exists and is globally asymptotically stable. When d ≥ 3, the trajectories
can however be very complicated and the convergence toward equilibrium very slow. A stochastic
system, how well ever fitted to the continuous state space, evolves in jumps and does not follow
any trajectory — only its local drift is in the best case close to the derivative of a trajectory
passing the same point. Thus, it is hard to imagine how the stability of the stochastic system could
be deduced without more specific assumptions. Second, a dynamic system can escape to infinity
along a single trajectory (say, along the diagonal) while all other trajectories end to a compact
set. In such a case, the stochastic systems with all N could however be stable, since randomness
forces them to deviate from the transient trajectory.
However, these circumstances often coincide, and, as we shall see here also, proving the stability
of the dynamical system is usually much easier than proving the stability of the Markov process.
Therefore it is interesting to consider the large system limits together with the original random
systems.
All the systems studied in this paper possess differentiable large system limits, and the existence
of a unique solution from any starting point is thus always granted. They are, however, non-linear,
and proving their stability seems to be very hard in some cases. There are no black-box tools
applicable in general.
The following elementary lemma is sometimes useful when considering the asymptotic behaviour
of a dynamical system. For completeness, a proof is given in the Appendix.
Lemma 2.1 Let a and b be Lipschitz continuous functions [0, ∞) → (0, ∞). The unique solution
u of the differential equation
u̇t = bt − at ut , t ≥ 0,
with initial condition u0 ≥ 0 is positive for every t > 0 and satisfies
lim supt→∞ bt
lim inf t→∞ bt
≤ lim inf ut ≤ lim sup ut ≤

lim inf t→∞ at

Models and results

3.1

Plain Random Contact system

Our first and simplest model is defined in Figure 1. The number of non-seed peers with chunk 0
(1) is denoted by X (Y ). Peers arrive according to a Poisson process with parameter λ, make a
random contact, download whatever chunk the contacted peer has (if the seed was contacted, the
downloaded chunk is chosen randomly), then make repeated random contacts at Poisson rate 1 until the remaining chunk is found, and leave the system. The system relies entirely on randomness,
with fatal consequences.

Figure 1: Plain Random Contact system
The large system limit of the Plain Random Contact system is the dynamical system defined by
the non-linear ordinary differential equations
ẋ =

(λ − y)x
x+y

ẏ =

(λ − x)y
x+y

(2)

This system limit is easily seen to be unstable even close to its equilibirium x = y = λ:
Proposition 3.1 In (0, ∞)2 , the system (2) has a single equilibrium (x∗ , y ∗ ) = (λ, λ). The system
is not stable in any environment of (x∗ , y ∗ ). Starting with x0 > λ > y0 we have xt → ∞ and
yt → 0, and vice versa.
Proof

This is immediate from the equations (2).



As long as both x and y are large and roughly of the same size, the system empties rapidly.
However, it is rather straightforward to prove that the stochastic system is unstable when λ is
larger than one.
Remark: In this paper, we are not interested in the possible stability of the system when the
input rate λ is sufficiently low. In all our models, λ appears in the large scale limits as a pure
scaling parameter that can be as well chosen to be one. The stability of the stochastic system may,
however, depend on λ. Susitaival and Aalto [12] study by simulations several two-chunk systems
also from the point of view of stability regions in terms of λ.

Proposition 3.2 With λ > 1, the (stochastic) Plain Random Contact system is unstable. More
exactly, almost surely either X or Y escapes to infinity whereas the other obtains ultimately only
the values 0 and 1.
We couple (X, Y ) with a process (X̃, Ỹ ) such that

Assume that λ > 1 and choose a number a ∈ (0, λ − 1). Let X̃ and Ỹ be mutually dependent,

follows, respectively:

since the rightmost integrand is O(t−2 ). Thus, Ỹ has the property (iii). Since
Z

Ỹs ds = 0 < a,
t→∞ t 0
we also obtain (ii).
Now, choose M ∈ N so large that

set X0 = X̃0 ≥ M , Y0 = Ỹ0 = 0 and define

τ = inf t : X̃t < at or Ỹt > 1 .

Then obviously P(τ = ∞) > 0, and on {τ = ∞} we can couple (X, Y ) with (X̃, Ỹ ) in the
desired way thanks to domination relations between the respective intensities. Hence, there exists
a positive number p such that

P lim Xt = ∞, Yt ∈ {0, 1} ultimately  X0 = x0 , Y0 = 0 > p > 0
(4)
t→∞

when x0 ≥ M . By symmetry, the corresponding relation holds if X and Y are interchanged.
Next, let R > (3/2)λ and note that
P((Xt , Yt ) ∈ [R ∨ M, ∞) × [R ∨ M, ∞) ultimately) = 0.
Indeed, when Xt ∧ Yt ≥ R, the total output rate of the system is larger than the total input rate λ:
2(Xt ∧ Yt )
2
> R > λ.
Xt ∧ Yt + 1
3
1+
X t ∨ Yt
Thus, {Xt ∧ Yt ≤ R ∨ M } is a recurrent event. By inspecting the intensities depicted in Figure 1
it is easy to see that the probability of moving from a state with X ∧ Y ≤ R ∨ M to a state with
X ∧ Y = 0 before a change in X ∨ Y is bounded from below by a positive constant not depending
on the value of X ∨ Y . It follows that
{Xt ∨ Yt ≥ R ∨ M, Xt ∧ Yt = 0}
is a recurrent event as well. Now, (4) yields the proposition.

3.2

Deterministic First Chunk system

Our first attempt to overcome the spontaneous imbalance tendency of the Plain Random Contact
system was the Deterministic Last Chunk mechanism introduced in [8], where each peer decides
in advance (randomly) which chunk it will download as the last one. The idea was to prevent peers
from downloading systematically the rarest chunk as the last one before leaving the system. In the
two-chunk case, defined by Figure 2, it might be more natural to speak about the Deterministic
First Chunk system. The number of empty peers determined to download chunk 0 (1) first is
denoted by A (B), while X and Y have their previous meaning.
Although this balancing rule worked promisingly well in our flash-crowd setup with many chunks,
the two-chunk system is probably unstable — at least its large system limit

We don’t have a proof for the stochastic case, but on the basis of similarity in behavior to the Plain
Random Contact system (and supported by some simulations), we conjecture that this system be
unstable as well:
8

Conjecture 3.4 With λ large enough, the (stochastic) Deterministic First Chunk system is unstable — a.s., either X or Y escapes to infinity, together with B or A, respectively.
However, we don’t fix a conjecture about a Deterministic Last Chunk system with three or more
chunks.

3.3

Friedman system

Consider an urn containing balls with two colors. The simplest version of Friedman’s urn [4]
works so that one repeatedly picks a random ball from the urn and returns it together with a ball
of the opposite color. The proportions of the two colors approach 12 − 12 [3].
We now modify the Plain Random Contact system by assuming (without bothering how this might
be realised) that arriving peers make a random contact and then enter the system with a copy of the
chunk that the contacted peer did not have (in the case that the seed was contacted, the downloaded
chunk is chosen randomly); we call this ’complementary’ random input ’Friedman input’. This
system is defined by Figure 3.

Delayed Friedman system

Our first distributed implementation of the idea of the Friedman system (see [11]) was the system
defined by Figure 4. An arriving peer first makes a random contact and then decides to download
first the chunk that the contacted peer does not have (in the case that the seed was contacted,
the peer decides randomly). As with the Deterministic First Chunk system, the number of empty
peers determined to download chunk 0 (1) first is denoted by A (B), while X and Y have the same
meaning as before. We call this the Delayed Friedman system, because the subsystem (X, Y )
obtains Friedman input with stochastic delay.

This system is difficult to analyse, because it oscillates heavily around its unique equilibrium
(a∗ , b∗ , x∗ , y ∗ ) = (λ, λ, λ, λ). The ’logic’ of the oscillating system evolution from an imbalanced
state, depicted in Figure 5, is the following:
• there is hardly any input to nor output from y
• the ’Friedman rule’ directs input to a, which accumulates almost all of it, since x is negligible
• when enough mass has accumulated to a, the balance starts to improve
• once x has become macroscopic, a and y empty rapidly
11

• b has not had time to grow, so we get a situation close to the mirror image of the original.

Numerical experiments like that shown in Figure 6 (left) hint to global stability, but we have not
found an explicit Lyapunov function or other means to prove this. As regards local behavior
near equilibrium, the linearised system at equilibrium is essentially a two-dimensional harmonic
oscillator — the two remaining dimensions correspond to negative eigenvalues. If we continue
the numerical computation of a trajectory of (7), we see slow convergence toward equilibrium
(Figure 6, right; by the way, it is interesting to observe that x + y seems to never descend below
2). Indeed, the system (7) turns out to be locally asymptotically stable, and this can be shown in a
non-elementary but basically straightforward way through a center manifold analysis (see [2, 6]).

Proposition 3.7 The system defined by (7) is locally asymptotically stable. If the starting point
(a0 , b0 , x0 , y0 )√is close enough to the equilibrium (λ, λ, λ, λ), the distance to it decreases proportionally to 1/ t.

Proof Since the common denominator of the right hand sides of (7) does not affect the trajectories, and since λ is a pure scaling factor, it is sufficient to consider the system

Thus, the system has a two-dimensional stable manifold W s and a two-dimensional center manifold W c . The corresponding columns of V are tangents to these at p (see e.g. [2]), and the
manifolds are invariant under the flow of the system. Trajectories close to p approach the center
manifold like t e−t . By the reduction principle (see [6]), in order to study the stability of the
system, it suffices to know how it behaves on the local center manifold. For this we will reduce
the system to a normal form (see [6]).
Take first a linear change of coordinates:
x = p + V [ uv ] ,

where

u, v ∈ R2 .

Then the local center manifold can be expressed as
u

W c = {p + V [ h(u) ] : kuk < d} ,
where h(u) is a two-vector with h(0, 0) = 0 and Dh(0, 0) = 0 (the latter because of tangency).
 c
Write ff s = V −1 f . Then the requirement of invariance of W c amounts to
u

u

f s (p + V [ h(u) ]) = Dh(u) f c (p + V [ h(u) ]) .
13

This is the equation for h . We can recursively solve the coefficients of the Taylor expansion of
h . Note that the constant and linear terms are zero. This way we get:

The behaviour of the system on the center manifold is given by equation u0 = g(u) . Following
[6] we change to complex variables. An eigenvector of the linear part of g corresponding to the
eigenvalue i is q = [ 1i ] . Setting u = z q + z̄ q̄ we get z = (u2 − i u1 )/2 and

Taking substitution z = w + β3 w3 + β2 w2 w̄ + β1 w w̄2 + β0 w̄3 we obtain

we see that w → 0 like 1/ t . Hence the system is locally asymptotically stable.



If the third order terms of the equation of w would not have determined the stability, we should
have gone to higher order expansions.
Our simulations showed that also the original stochastic system oscillates strongly, with a roughly
constant amplitude depending on λ, even when it is started from a balanced state. The simulations
suggested that the stochastic system might be stable, but we have not found a way to prove or
disprove this. From a practical viewpoint, the oscillations indicate that the system is not in good
balance, which could be fatal in an application with rapidly changing arrival rates and flash crowd
scenarios.

Enforced Friedman system

The reason of the oscillatory behaviour of the Delayed Friedman system was that when a peer
finally succeeds in downloading its first chunk according to the ’Friedman rule’, applied possibly
long ago, the choice may already be outdated and thus counterproductive. Our last model avoids
this problem by realising choices only immediately or not at all. An empty peer makes three
contacts simultaneously (sampling with replacement; the seed shows a random chunk). If two of
the chunks of the contacted peers differ from the third one, the latter is downloaded. If all three
chunks are similar, nothing is done, but the empty peer stays in a waiting room and repeats the
triple contact operation after Exp(1)-distributed waiting time. The number of peers in the waiting
room is denoted by Z. Note that if the experiment was successful (that is, a 2-1 situation was
obtained), the probability of downloading chunk 0 is (Y + 12 )/(X + Y + 1) — exactly the same
as in the Friedman system! Therefore we call this system, defined by Figure 7, the Enforced
Friedman system.

Proposition 3.8 The system (8) has in (0, ∞) × (0, ∞) × (0, ∞) a single equilibrium point
(z ∗ , x∗ , y ∗ ) = ( 34 λ, λ, λ). Locally, the equilibrium is a sink, i.e. all eigenvalues of the limiting
linear system are real and negative. This equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable.
Proof The uniqueness and local character of the equilibrium are found by easy computations.
It remains to prove the global stability. Since λ is a pure scaling parameter, we can choose λ = 1.
Let us change to the variables

Fix arbitrary initial values z0 > 0, ρ0 > 0, β0 ∈ (0, 1) (β0 = 0 gives a simple linear system).
1o . Note first that the system (zt , ρt , βt ) cannot escape from the set (0, ∞)×(0, ∞)×[0, 1) in finite
time. Denote τ = inf {t ≥ 0 : βt = 1}. For t ∈ [0, τ ), żt > 0 whenever zt < 4/3, and ρ̇t > 0
whenever ρt < (3/2)zt . Since the system freezes at τ , it follows that inf t≥0 zt ≥ min(z0 , 4/3) and
inf t≥0 ρt > 0. Equation (12) then yields that β cannot reach 1 at any finite time, so τ = ∞.
2o . A basic observation from the equations (9) is that the absolute value of x − y is non-increasing.
In terms of the variables z, ρ, β this means that βρ2 is non-increasing, and the corresponding
equation from which this is seen reads

Assume that βt → 1. Since βt ρ2t is decreasing by (13), ρt cannot be ultimately increasing, and it
approaches some finite limit value. On the other hand, Lemma 2.1, applied to (10), yields with
βt → 1 that zt → ∞, and (11) makes ρt ultimately increasing. This contradiction shows that
w := 1 − lim inf t→∞ βt > 0.
Since we already saw that ultimately zt ≥ 1, we obtain by (14) and (12) (neglecting the term 3z/ρ

then, (14) and (15) imply limt→∞ βt = 0.
3o . Now, Lemma 2.1 yields that zt and ρt converge to their stable values.



In simulations, this scheme seems to work in a perfect way, and it is also capable to deal with flash
crowds and rapid input rate variations as well (say, when λ is large for a while and then suddenly
drops). We also have good intuitive grounds to believe that the stochastic Enforced Friedman
system be stable: as noted earlier, the output from the waiting room is pure Friedman input to
the subsystem (X, Y ), just with a randomly varying rate. Since the Friedman system is provably
stable with any input rate λ, the same can be expected from the Enforced Friedman system:
Conjecture 3.9 The (stochastic) Enforced Friedman system is stable with any input rate λ.

Concluding remarks

Although we could so far prove only some of the stability/non-stability properties that seem to
hold for our models, some preliminary conclusions can already be drawn. First, we showed that
it is possible to create effectively stabilizing ’Friedman input’ using a fully distributed algorithm
based on random contacts. Second, one should use a ’waiting room’ concept with memoryless
re-trials rather than launch an active hunt for a rare chunk — the rarity may dissolve during the
hunt, leading to oscillations. Third, the extra delay caused by the waiting room stage is relatively
small in the mean, certainly worth its price. We also believe that the idea of Enforced Friedman
input has usable counterparts in many-chunk systems, and we work currently on one promising
candidate.
On the other hand, note that our models lack realism as regards the modelling of two aspects of
the system: search and downloading. Following [7], the slowness of downloading is modelled
by the Exp(1)-distributed inter-contact times, whereas the contacts themselves are assumed to be
instant. However, unsuccessful contacts could be repeated much faster than those leading to a
chunk download. Assessing the significance of this simplification remains for further work.

Appendix
of Lemma 2.1.

Denote τ = inf {t > 0 : ut = 0}. Since u̇0 = b0 > 0 in the case that u0 = 0, we always have
τ > 0. For t ∈ [0, τ ) we have
u̇t ≥ inf bs − ( sup as )ut .
s∈[0,τ )

s∈[0,τ )

It follows that
ut ≥

+ (u0 −
) exp(−( sup as )t),
sups∈[0,τ ) as
sups∈[0,τ ) as
s∈[0,τ )

t ∈ [0, τ ).

Since the right hand side is positive also for every t = τ , we deduce that τ = ∞.
Assume first that the functions a and b are bounded away from zero and infinity. Let a∗ , a∗ , b∗ , b∗
be any positive numbers such that
a∗ < lim inf at ≤ lim sup at < a∗ ,

Since a∗ , a∗ , b∗ , b∗ were arbitrary, the assertion follows.
Finally, when a and b are not both bounded away from zero and infinity and the fractions in
the assertion are well-defined, the non-trivial cases are obtained as above, simply relaxing some
conditions in the definition of σ.
