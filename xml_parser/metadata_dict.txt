As consequence, often\nneither methods nor knowledge can be reused. In addition, the knowledge\nengineer must have programming skills in order to enhance and evaluate the\nsystem. One particular challenge is to tackle these problems with the\ndevelopment of a generic tutoring system. AnITA, as a stand-alone application,\nhas been developed and implemented particularly for this purpose. However, in\nthe testing phase, we discovered that this architecture did not fully match the\nuser's intuitive understanding of the use of a learning tool. Therefore, AnITA\nhas been redesigned to exclusively work as a client/server application and\nrenamed to AnITA2. This paper discusses the evolvements made on the AnITA\ntutoring system, the goal of which is to use generic principles for system\nre-use in any domain. Two experiments were conducted, and the results are\npresented in this paper.

It is\nargued that this phenomenon occurs as a combination of the negative curvature\nproperty of the network together with minimum length routing. More\nspecifically, it is shown that, in a large n-dimensional hyperbolic ball B of\nradius R viewed as a roughly similar model of a Gromov hyperbolic network, the\nproportion of traffic paths transiting through a small ball near the center is\nindependent of the radius R whereas, in a Euclidean ball, the same proportion\nscales as 1/R^{n-1}. This discrepancy persists for the traffic load, which at\nthe center of the hyperbolic ball scales as the square of the volume, whereas\nthe same traffic load scales as the volume to the power (n+1)/n in the\nEuclidean ball. This provides a theoretical justification of the experimental\nexponent discrepancy observed by Narayan and Saniee between traffic loads in\nGromov-hyperbolic networks from the Rocketfuel data base and synthetic\nEuclidean lattice networks. It is further conjectured that for networks that do\nnot enjoy the obvious symmetry of hyperbolic and Euclidean balls, the point of\nmaximum traffic is near the center of mass of the network.

This paper generalizes\nthe notion of \\emph{incoherence} in the existing literature on model selection\nand introduces two fundamental measures of coherence---termed as the worst-case\ncoherence and the average coherence---among the columns of a design matrix. In\nparticular, it utilizes these two measures of coherence to provide an in-depth\nanalysis of a simple one-step thresholding (OST) algorithm for model selection.\nOne of the key insights offered by the ensuing analysis is that OST is feasible\nfor model selection as long as the design matrix obeys an easily verifiable\nproperty. In addition, the paper also characterizes the model-selection\nperformance of OST in terms of the worst-case coherence, \\mu, and establishes\nthat OST performs near-optimally in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime for N\nx C design matrices with \\mu = O(N^{-1/2}). Finally, in contrast to some of the\nexisting literature on model selection, the analysis in the paper is\nnonasymptotic in nature, it does not require knowledge of the true model order,\nit is applicable to generic (random or deterministic) design matrices, and it\nneither requires submatrices of the design matrix to have full rank, nor does\nit assume a statistical prior on the values of the nonzero entries of the data\nvector.

Each agent $v$\ninitially receives a private measurement of $\\theta$: a number $S_v$ picked\nfrom a Gaussian distribution with mean $\\theta$ and standard deviation one.\nThen, in each discrete time iteration, each reveals its estimate of $\\theta$ to\nits neighbors, and, observing its neighbors' actions, updates its belief using\nBayes' Law.\n  This process aggregates information efficiently, in the sense that all the\nagents converge to the belief that they would have, had they access to all the\nprivate measurements. We show that this process is computationally efficient,\nso that each agent's calculation can be easily carried out. We also show that\non any graph the process converges after at most $2N \\cdot D$ steps, where $N$\nis the number of agents and $D$ is the diameter of the network. Finally, we\nshow that on trees and on distance transitive-graphs the process converges\nafter $D$ steps, and that it preserves privacy, so that agents learn very\nlittle about the private signal of most other agents, despite the efficient\naggregation of information.

It works by splitting communication across a pair of fading\nmatrices. However, it comes with the overhead of a long time delay until\nmatchable matrices occur: the delay is q^n^2 for field size q.\n  In this paper, we outline two new families of schemes, called JAP and JAP-B,\nthat reduce the expected delay, sometimes at the cost of a reduction in rate\nfrom the NGJV scheme. In particular, we give examples of good schemes for\nnetworks with few users, and show that in large n-user networks, the delay\nscales like q^T, where T is quadratic in n for a constant per-user rate and T\nis constant for a constant sum-rate. We also show that half the single-user\nrate can be achieved while reducing NGJV's delay from q^n^2 to q^(n-1)(n-2).\n  This extended version includes complete proofs and more details of good\nschemes for small n.

The nodes in the\nnetwork are equipped with hardware clocks, but the rate of the hardware clocks\ncan vary arbitrarily within specific bounds, and the estimates that nodes can\nobtain about the clock values of other nodes are inherently inaccurate. Our\ngoal in this setting is to output a logical clock at each node such that the\nlogical clocks of any two nodes are not too far apart, and nodes that remain\nclose to each other in the network for a long time are better synchronized than\ndistant nodes. This property is called gradient clock synchronization.\n  Gradient clock synchronization has been widely studied in the static setting,\nwhere the network topology does not change. We show that the asymptotically\noptimal bounds obtained for the static case also apply to our highly dynamic\nsetting: if two nodes remain at distance $d$ from each other for sufficiently\nlong, it is possible to upper bound the difference between their clock values\nby $O(d \\log (D / d))$, where $D$ is the diameter of the network. This is known\nto be optimal even for static networks. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm\nhas optimal stabilization time: when a path of length $d$ appears between two\nnodes, the time required until the clock skew between the two nodes is reduced\nto $O(d \\log (D / d))$ is $O(D)$, which we prove to be optimal. Finally, the\ntechniques employed for the more intricate analysis of the algorithm for\ndynamic graphs provide additional insights that are also of interest for the\nstatic setting. In particular, we establish self-stabilization of the gradient\nproperty within $O(D)$ time.

Two Fundamental Measures of Coherence and Their Role\n  in Model Selection,This paper studies non-asymptotic model selection for the general case of\narbitrary design matrices and arbitrary nonzero entries of the signal. In this\nregard, it generalizes the notion of incoherence in the existing literature on\nmodel selection and introduces two fundamental measures of coherence---termed\nas the worst-case coherence and the average coherence---among the columns of a\ndesign matrix. It utilizes these two measures of coherence to provide an\nin-depth analysis of a simple, model-order agnostic one-step thresholding (OST)\nalgorithm for model selection and proves that OST is feasible for exact as well\nas partial model selection as long as the design matrix obeys an easily\nverifiable property. One of the key insights offered by the ensuing analysis in\nthis regard is that OST can successfully carry out model selection even when\nmethods based on convex optimization such as the lasso fail due to the rank\ndeficiency of the submatrices of the design matrix. In addition, the paper\nestablishes that if the design matrix has reasonably small worst-case and\naverage coherence then OST performs near-optimally when either (i) the energy\nof any nonzero entry of the signal is close to the average signal energy per\nnonzero entry or (ii) the signal-to-noise ratio in the measurement system is\nnot too high. Finally, two other key contributions of the paper are that (i) it\nprovides bounds on the average coherence of Gaussian matrices and Gabor frames,\nand (ii) it extends the results on model selection using OST to low-complexity,\nmodel-order agnostic recovery of sparse signals with arbitrary nonzero entries.

We developed a\nsimple method that uses a chi-square-based scoring function to determine the\nlikelihood of MEDLINE citations containing genetic relevant topic. Methods: Our\nprocedure requires construction of a genetic and a nongenetic domain document\ncorpus. We used MeSH descriptors assigned to MEDLINE citations for this\ncategorization task. We compared frequencies of MeSH descriptors between two\ncorpora applying chi-square test. A MeSH descriptor was considered to be a\npositive indicator if its relative observed frequency in the genetic domain\ncorpus was greater than its relative observed frequency in the nongenetic\ndomain corpus. The output of the proposed method is a list of scores for all\nthe citations, with the highest score given to those citations containing MeSH\ndescriptors typical for the genetic domain. Results: Validation was done on a\nset of 734 manually annotated MEDLINE citations. It achieved predictive\naccuracy of 0.87 with 0.69 recall and 0.64 precision. We evaluated the method\nby comparing it to three machine learning algorithms (support vector machines,\ndecision trees, na\\\"ive Bayes). Although the differences were not statistically\nsignificantly different, results showed that our chi-square scoring performs as\ngood as compared machine learning algorithms. Conclusions: We suggest that the\nchi-square scoring is an effective solution to help categorize MEDLINE\ncitations.

This paper studies the problem of\nidentification of underspread linear systems (ULSs), whose responses lie within\na unit-area region in the delay Doppler space, by probing them with a known\ninput signal. It is shown that sufficiently-underspread parametric linear\nsystems, described by a finite set of delays and Doppler-shifts, are\nidentifiable from a single observation as long as the time bandwidth product of\nthe input signal is proportional to the square of the total number of delay\nDoppler pairs in the system. In addition, an algorithm is developed that\nenables identification of parametric ULSs from an input train of pulses in\npolynomial time by exploiting recent results on sub-Nyquist sampling for time\ndelay estimation and classical results on recovery of frequencies from a sum of\ncomplex exponentials.

The effectiveness of a community detection algorithm is\ndetermined by accuracy in finding the ground-truth communities and ability to\nscale with the size of the data. In this work, we provide three contributions.\nFirst, we show that a popular measure of accuracy known as the F1 score, which\nis between 0 and 1, with 1 being perfect detection, has an information lower\nbound is 0.5. We provide a trivial algorithm that produces communities with an\nF1 score of 0.5 for any graph! Somewhat surprisingly, we find that popular\nalgorithms such as modularity optimization, BigClam and CESNA have F1 scores\nless than 0.5 for the popular IMDB graph. To rectify this, as the second\ncontribution we propose a generative model for community formation, the\nsequential community graph, which is motivated by the formation of social\nnetworks. Third, motivated by our generative model, we propose the\nleader-follower algorithm (LFA). We prove that it recovers all communities for\nsequential community graphs by establishing a structural result that sequential\ncommunity graphs are chordal. For a large number of popular social networks, it\nrecovers communities with a much higher F1 score than other popular algorithms.\nFor the IMDB graph, it obtains an F1 score of 0.81. We also propose a\nmodification to the LFA called the fast leader-follower algorithm (FLFA) which\nin addition to being highly accurate, is also fast, with a scaling that is\nalmost linear in the network size.

This paper examines the problem of multiuser detection (MUD) in random\naccess channels for such applications. Traditional orthogonal signaling ignores\nthe random nature of user activity in this problem and limits the total number\nof users to be on the order of the number of signal space dimensions.\nContention-based schemes, on the other hand, suffer from delays caused by\ncolliding transmissions and the hidden node problem. In contrast, this paper\npresents a novel pairing of an asynchronous non-orthogonal code-division random\naccess scheme with a convex optimization-based MUD algorithm that overcomes the\nissues associated with orthogonal signaling and contention-based methods. Two\nkey distinguishing features of the proposed MUD algorithm are that it does not\nrequire knowledge of the delay or channel state information of every user and\nit has polynomial-time computational complexity. The main analytical\ncontribution of this paper is the relationship between the performance of the\nproposed MUD algorithm in the presence of arbitrary or random delays and two\nsimple metrics of the set of user codewords.

The topic of\nthis paper is a model-based community finding approach, commonly referred to as\nmodularity clustering, that was originally proposed by Newman and has\nsubsequently been extremely popular in practice. Various heuristic methods are\ncurrently employed for finding the optimal solution. However, the exact\ncomputational complexity of this approach is still largely unknown.\n  To this end, we initiate a systematic study of the computational complexity\nof modularity clustering. Due to the specific quadratic nature of the\nmodularity function, it is necessary to study its value on sparse graphs and\ndense graphs separately. Our main results include a (1+\\eps)-inapproximability\nfor dense graphs and a logarithmic approximation for sparse graphs. We make use\nof several combinatorial properties of modularity to get these results. These\nare the first non-trivial approximability results beyond the previously known\nNP-hardness results.

In the case where the surfaces are spheres and no\nthree spheres meet in a common circle, this implies there are $O((mn)^{3/4} + m\n+n)$ point-sphere incidences. This is a slight improvement over the previous\nbound of $O((mn)^{3/4} \\beta(m,n)+ m +n)$ for $\\beta(m,n)$ an (explicit) very\nslowly growing function. We obtain this bound by using the discrete polynomial\nham sandwich theorem to cut $\\mathbb{R}^3$ into open cells adapted to the set\nof points, and within each cell of the decomposition we apply a Turan-type\ntheorem to obtain crude control on the number of point-surface incidences.

In this context, the present paper develops novel fixed-lag and\nfixed-interval smoothing algorithms that are robust to outliers simultaneously\npresent in the measurements {\\it and} in the state dynamics. Outliers are\nhandled through auxiliary unknown variables that are jointly estimated along\nwith the state based on the least-squares criterion that is regularized with\nthe $\\ell_1$-norm of the outliers in order to effect sparsity control. The\nresultant iterative estimators rely on coordinate descent and the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers, are expressed in closed form per iteration,\nand are provably convergent. Additional attractive features of the novel doubly\nrobust smoother include: i) ability to handle both types of outliers; ii)\nuniversality to unknown nominal noise and outlier distributions; iii)\nflexibility to encompass maximum a posteriori optimal estimators with reliable\nperformance under nominal conditions; and iv) improved performance relative to\ncompeting alternatives at comparable complexity, as corroborated via simulated\ntests. Comment: Submitted to IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing", "1104.5288": "Tracking Target Signal Strengths on a Grid using Sparsity,Multi-target tracking is mainly challenged by the nonlinearity present in the\nmeasurement equation, and the difficulty in fast and accurate data association.\nTo overcome these challenges, the present paper introduces a grid-based model\nin which the state captures target signal strengths on a known spatial grid\n(TSSG). This model leads to \\emph{linear} state and measurement equations,\nwhich bypass data association and can afford state estimation via\nsparsity-aware Kalman filtering (KF). Leveraging the grid-induced sparsity of\nthe novel model, two types of sparsity-cognizant TSSG-KF trackers are\ndeveloped: one effects sparsity through $\\ell_1$-norm regularization, and the\nother invokes sparsity as an extra measurement. Iterative extended KF and\nGauss-Newton algorithms are developed for reduced-complexity tracking, along\nwith accurate error covariance updates for assessing performance of the\nresultant sparsity-aware state estimators. Based on TSSG state estimates, more\ninformative target position and track estimates can be obtained in a follow-up\nstep, ensuring that track association and position estimation errors do not\npropagate back into TSSG state estimates. The novel TSSG trackers do not\nrequire knowing the number of targets or their signal strengths, and exhibit\nconsiderably lower complexity than the benchmark hidden Markov model filter,\nespecially for a large number of targets. Numerical simulations demonstrate\nthat sparsity-cognizant trackers enjoy improved root mean-square error\nperformance at reduced complexity when compared to their sparsity-agnostic\ncounterparts. Comment: Submitted to IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing", "1105.1302": "A Modified Cross Correlation Algorithm for Reference-free Image\n  Alignment of Non-Circular Projections in Single-Particle Electron Microscopy,In this paper we propose a modified cross correlation method to align images\nfrom the same class in single-particle electron microscopy of highly\nnon-spherical structures. In this new method, First we coarsely align\nprojection images, and then re-align the resulting images using the cross\ncorrelation (CC) method. The coarse alignment is obtained by matching the\ncenters of mass and the principal axes of the images. The distribution of\nmisalignment in this coarse alignment can be quantified based on the\nstatistical properties of the additive background noise. As a consequence, the\nsearch space for re-alignment in the cross correlation method can be reduced to\nachieve better alignment. In order to overcome problems associated with false\npeaks in the cross correlations function, we use artificially blurred images\nfor the early stage of the iterative cross correlation method and segment the\nintermediate class average from every iteration step. These two additional\nmanipulations combined with the reduced search space size in the cross\ncorrelation method yield better alignments for low signal-to-noise ratio images\nthan both classical cross correlation and maximum likelihood(ML) methods.

In fact it is strictly related to\nmaximum likelihood estimation of bilateral AR-type representations of acausal\nsignals subject to certain conditional independence constraints. The maximum\nentropy completion problem for block-circulant matrices has recently been\nsolved by the authors, although leaving open the problem of an efficient\ncomputation of the solution. In this paper, we provide an effcient algorithm\nfor computing its solution which compares very favourably with existing\nalgorithms designed for positive definite matrix extension problems.

We prove that the problem can be solved in\npolynomial time using $s$ colours on maps whose underlying adjacency graph has\nno induced subgraph of average degree larger than $s/r$. However, if $s \\geq\n3$, the problem is NP-hard even if the graph is a forest of paths of arbitrary\nlengths (for any $r \\geq 2$, provided $s < 2r - \\sqrt(2r + 1/4+ 3/2)$.\nFurthermore we obtain a complete characterization of the problem's complexity\nfor the case when the input graph is a tree, whereas our result for arbitrary\nplanar graphs fall just short of a similar dichotomy.

These new\nsettings include problems where in addition, or instead, of energy costs we\nalso have maintenance costs, wear and tear, replacement costs, etc., which in\ngeneral depend on the speed at which the machine runs but also depend on the\ntypes of jobs processed. Our algorithms also extend to approximating weighted\ntardiness plus energy cost, an inherently more difficult problem that has not\nbeen addressed in the literature.

This class includes problems where the forward\nmodel is the solution operator to linear ODEs or PDEs. The tremendous size of\nsuch problems motivates dimensionality reduction techniques based on randomly\nmixing experiments. These techniques break down, however, when robust\ndata-fitting formulations are used, which are essential in cases of missing\ndata, unusually large errors, and systematic features in the data unexplained\nby the forward model. We survey robust methods within a statistical framework,\nand propose a semistochastic optimization approach that allows dimensionality\nreduction. The efficacy of the methods are demonstrated for a large-scale\nseismic inverse problem using the robust Student's t-distribution, where a\nuseful synthetic velocity model is recovered in the extreme scenario of 60%\ndata missing at random. The semistochastic approach achieves this recovery\nusing 20% of the effort required by a direct robust approach.

It is shown\nthat the \"actionable information gap\" between the two can be reduced by\nexercising control on the sensing process. Thus, senging, control and\ninformation are inextricably tied. This has consequences in the so-called\n\"signal-to-symbol barrier\" problem, as well as in the analysis and design of\nactive sensing systems.

In a joint work of Marzetta, Tucci and Simon, a new\napproach to handle singular covariance matrices was suggested. The main idea\nwas to use dimensionality reduction in conjunction with an average over the\nStiefel manifold. In this paper we continue with this research and we consider\nsome new approaches to solve this problem. One of the methods is called the\nEwens estimator and uses a randomization of the sample covariance matrix over\nall the permutation matrices with respect to the Ewens measure.

The interpretation proposed in this paper rests on\nthe identity $\\ln\\det B=\\tr\\ln B$ applied to the cofactors of the matrix\n$I-tA,$ where $A$ is the weighted adjacency matrix of a weighted multigraph and\n$t$ is a sufficiently small positive parameter. In addition, this\ninterpretation is based on the power series expansion of the logarithm of a\nmatrix. Kasteleyn (1967) was probably the first to apply the foregoing approach\nto expanding the determinant of $I-A$. We show that using a certain linear\ntransformation the same approach can be extended to the cofactors of $I-tA,$\nwhich provides a topological interpretation of the walk distances.

This\nnotion is extended for independent random matrices invariant in law by\nconjugation by permutation matrices. This fact leads naturally to an extension\nof free probability, formalized under the notions of traffic probability. We\nfirst establish this construction for random matrices. We define the traffic\ndistribution of random matrices, which is richer than the *-distribution of\nfree probability. The knowledge of the individual traffic distributions of\nindependent permutation invariant families of matrices is sufficient to compute\nthe limiting distribution of the join family. Under a factorization assumption,\nwe call traffic independence the asymptotic rule that plays the role of\nindependence with respect to traffic distributions. Wigner matrices, Haar\nunitary matrices and uniform permutation matrices converge in traffic\ndistributions, a fact which yields new results on the limiting *-distributions\nof several matrices we can construct from them. Then we define the abstract\ntraffic spaces as non commutative probability spaces with more structure. We\nprove that at an algebraic level, traffic independence in some sense unifies\nthe three canonical notions of tensor, free and Boolean independence. A central\nlimiting theorem is stated in this context, interpolating between the tensor,\nfree and Boolean central limit theorems. Comment: Final version.

While exhaustive search remains asymptotically\nthe fastest known algorithm for some basic problems, difficult and non-trivial\nexponential time algorithms have been found for a myriad of problems, including\nGraph Coloring, Hamiltonian Path, Dominating Set and 3-CNF-Sat. In some\ninstances, improving these algorithms further seems to be out of reach. The\nCNF-Sat problem is the canonical example of a problem for which the trivial\nexhaustive search algorithm runs in time O(2^n), where n is the number of\nvariables in the input formula. While there exist non-trivial algorithms for\nCNF-Sat that run in time o(2^n), no algorithm was able to improve the growth\nrate 2 to a smaller constant, and hence it is natural to conjecture that 2 is\nthe optimal growth rate. The strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH) by\nImpagliazzo and Paturi [JCSS 2001] goes a little bit further and asserts that,\nfor every epsilon<1, there is a (large) integer k such that that k-CNF-Sat\ncannot be computed in time 2^{epsilon n}.\n  In this paper, we show that, for every epsilon < 1, the problems Hitting Set,\nSet Splitting, and NAE-Sat cannot be computed in time O(2^{epsilon n}) unless\nSETH fails. Here n is the number of elements or variables in the input. For\nthese problems, we actually get an equivalence to SETH in a certain sense. We\nconjecture that SETH implies a similar statement for Set Cover, and prove that,\nunder this assumption, the fastest known algorithms for Steinter Tree,\nConnected Vertex Cover, Set Partitioning, and the pseudo-polynomial time\nalgorithm for Subset Sum cannot be significantly improved. Finally, we justify\nour assumption about the hardness of Set Cover by showing that the parity of\nthe number of set covers cannot be computed in time O(2^{epsilon n}) for any\nepsilon<1 unless SETH fails.

Such models generally assume that\nexcitatory and inhibitory neurons are able to interact easily, because their\naxons and dendrites are co-localized in the same small volume. However,\nquantitative neuroanatomical studies of the dimensions of axonal and dendritic\ntrees of neurons in the neocortex show that this co-localization assumption is\nnot valid. In this paper we describe a simple modification to the WTA circuit\ndesign that permits the effects of distributed inhibitory neurons to be coupled\nthrough synchronization, and so allows a single WTA to be distributed widely in\ncortical space, well beyond the arborization of any single inhibitory neuron,\nand even across different cortical areas. We prove by non-linear contraction\nanalysis, and demonstrate by simulation that distributed WTA sub-systems\ncombined by such inhibitory synchrony are inherently stable. We show\nanalytically that synchronization is substantially faster than winner\nselection. This circuit mechanism allows networks of independent WTAs to fully\nor partially compete with each other.

A novel algorithm is\npresented that yields a parametrization of all shortest feedback shift\nregisters for the sequence of numbers S_1,...,S_N, thus solving an open problem\nin the literature. The algorithm iteratively processes each number, starting\nwith S_1, and constructs at each step a particular type of minimal Gr\\\"obner\nbasis. The construction involves a simple update rule at each step which leads\nto computational efficiency. It is shown that the algorithm simultaneously\ncomputes a similar parametrization for the reciprocal sequence S_N,...,S_1.

Maybe surprisingly, we find that\nthese families---though they require a large buffer of random numbers---are\noften faster than popular hash functions with weaker theoretical guarantees.\nMoreover, conventional wisdom is that hash functions with fewer multiplications\nare faster. Yet we find that they may fail to be faster due to operation\npipelining. We present experimental results on several processors including\nlow-powered processors. Our tests include hash functions designed for\nprocessors with the Carry-Less Multiplication (CLMUL) instruction set. We also\nprove, using accessible proofs, the strong universality of our families.

However, the embedding\napproach, which advantageously converts the hybrid optimal control problem to a\nclassical nonlinear optimization, has not been extensively compared to\nalternative solution approaches. The goal of this paper is thus to compare the\nembedding approach to multi-parametric programming, mixed-integer programming\n(e.g., CPLEX), and gradient-descent based methods in the context of five\nrecently published examples: a spring-mass system, moving-target tracking for a\nmobile robot, two-tank filling, DC-DC boost converter, and skid-steered\nvehicle. A sixth example, an autonomous switched 11-region linear system, is\nused to compare a hybrid minimum principle method and traditional numerical\nprogramming. For a given performance index for each case, cost and solution\ntimes are presented. It is shown that there are numerical advantages of the\nembedding approach: lower performance index cost (except in some instances when\nautonomous switches are present), generally faster solution time, and\nconvergence to a solution when other methods may fail. In addition, the\nembedding method requires no ad hoc assumptions (e.g., predetermined mode\nsequences) or specialized control models. Theoretical advantages of the\nembedding approach over the other methods are also described: guaranteed\nexistence of a solution under mild conditions, convexity of the embedded hybrid\noptimization problem (under the customary conditions on the performance index),\nsolvability with traditional techniques (e.g., sequential quadratic\nprogramming) avoiding the combinatorial complexity in the number of\nmodes/discrete variables of mixed-integer programming, applicability to affine\nnonlinear systems, and no need to explicitly assign discrete/mode variables to\nautonomous switches.

The\nmodification, termed constrained random demodulator, involves replacing the\nrandom waveform, essential to the operation of the RD, with a constrained\nrandom waveform that has limits on its switching rate because fast switching\nwaveforms may be hard to generate cleanly. The result is a relaxation on the\nhardware requirements with a slight, but manageable, decrease in the recovery\nguarantees. The paper also establishes the importance of properly choosing the\nstatistics of the constrained random waveform. If the power spectrum of the\nrandom waveform matches the distribution on the tones of the input signal\n(i.e., the distribution is proportional to the power spectrum), then recovery\nof the input signal tones is improved. The theoretical guarantees provided in\nthe paper are validated through extensive numerical simulations and phase\ntransition plots.

This agent-based model captures the essential\nfeatures of the agreement dynamics by means of a memory-based negotiation\nprocess. Our study focuses on the impact of time-varying properties of the\nsocial network of the agents on the naming game dynamics. In particular, we\nperform a computational exploration of this model using simulations on top of\nreal networks. We investigate the outcomes of the dynamics on two different\ntypes of time-varying data - (i) the networks vary on a day-to-day basis and\n(ii) the networks vary within very short intervals of time (20 seconds). In the\nfirst case, we find that networks with strong community structure hinder the\nsystem from reaching global agreement; the evolution of the naming game in\nthese networks maintains clusters of coexisting opinions indefinitely leading\nto metastability. In the second case, we investigate the evolution of the\nnaming game in perfect synchronization with the time evolution of the\nunderlying social network shedding new light on the traditional emergent\nproperties of the game that differ largely from what has been reported in the\nexisting literature.

In contrast, we present a grounded\nuser-based approach for automatically detecting interesting key-frames within a\nvideo through aggregated users' replay interactions with the video player.\nPrevious research has focused on content-based systems that have the benefit of\nanalyzing a video without user interactions, but they are monolithic, because\nthe resulting video thumbnails are the same regardless of the user preferences.\nWe constructed a user interest function, which is based on aggregate video\nreplays, and analyzed hundreds of user interactions.

We ask if it is possible for\nparty A to publish some information about each user so that B can estimate the\ndistance between users without being able to infer any private bit of a user.\nOur method involves projecting each user's representation into a random,\nlower-dimensional space via a sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform and then\nadding Gaussian noise to each entry of the lower-dimensional representation. We\nshow that the method preserves differential privacy---where the more privacy is\ndesired, the larger the variance of the Gaussian noise. Further, we show how to\napproximate the true distances between users via only the lower-dimensional,\nperturbed data. Finally, we consider other perturbation methods such as\nrandomized response and draw comparisons to sketch-based methods. While the\ngoal of releasing user-specific data to third parties is more broad than\npreserving distances, this work shows that distance computations with privacy\nis an achievable goal.

Moreover, we implemented an\nalgorithm that selects representative thumbnails. Finally, we populated the\nsystem with data from an experiment with nine users. We found that the\nVideoSkip system indexes video content by leveraging implicit users\ninteractions, such as pause and thirty seconds skip. Our early findings point\ntoward improvements of the web video player and its thumbnail generation\ntechnique.

We\ndefine and characterize all symmetric vanishing signatures. They turned out to\nbe essential to the complete classification of Holant problems. The dichotomy\ntheorem has an explicit tractability criterion expressible in terms of\nholographic transformations. A Holant problem defined by a set of constraint\nfunctions F is solvable in polynomial time if it satisfies this tractability\ncriterion, and is #P-hard otherwise. The tractability criterion can be\nintuitively stated as follows: A set F is tractable if (1) every function in F\nhas arity at most two, or (2) F is transformable to an affine type, or (3) F is\ntransformable to a product type, or (4) F is vanishing, combined with the right\ntype of binary functions, or (5) F belongs to a special category of vanishing\ntype Fibonacci gates. The proof of this theorem utilizes many previous\ndichotomy theorems on Holant problems and Boolean #CSP. Holographic\ntransformations play an indispensable role as both a proof technique and in the\nstatement of the tractability criterion.

The {\\em total chromatic number} of a graph\n$G$, denoted by $\\chiup''(G)$, is the minimum number of colors in a total\ncoloring of $G$.

A graph is {\\em $1$-toroidal} if it can be drawn in torus such\nthat every edge crosses at most one other edge. In this paper, we investigate\nthe total coloring of $1$-toroidal graphs, and prove that the TCC holds for the\n$1$-toroidal graphs with maximum degree at least~$11$ and some restrictions on\nthe triangles.

We then extend our analysis to\nbiased stochastic errors, by first characterizing a family of samplers and\nproviding a high probability bound that allows understanding not only FBS, but\nalso proximal gradient (PG) methods. We derive some interesting conclusions:\nFBS requires only a logarithmically increasing number of random samples in\norder to converge (although at a very low rate); the required number of random\nsamples is the same for the deterministic and the biased stochastic setting for\nFBS and basic PG; accelerated PG is not guaranteed to converge in the biased\nstochastic setting.

Connected choice is the operation that finds a point in a\nnon-empty connected closed set given by negative information. One of our main\nresults is that for any fixed dimension the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem of that\ndimension is computably equivalent to connected choice of the Euclidean unit\ncube of the same dimension. Another main result is that connected choice is\ncomplete for dimension greater than or equal to two in the sense that it is\ncomputably equivalent to Weak K\\H{o}nig's Lemma. While we can present two\nindependent proofs for dimension three and upwards that are either based on a\nsimple geometric construction or a combinatorial argument, the proof for\ndimension two is based on a more involved inverse limit construction. The\nconnected choice operation in dimension one is known to be equivalent to the\nIntermediate Value Theorem; we prove that this problem is not idempotent in\ncontrast to the case of dimension two and upwards. We also prove that Lipschitz\ncontinuity with Lipschitz constants strictly larger than one does not simplify\nfinding fixed points. Finally, we prove that finding a connectedness component\nof a closed subset of the Euclidean unit cube of any dimension greater or equal\nto one is equivalent to Weak K\\H{o}nig's Lemma. In order to describe these\nresults, we introduce a representation of closed subsets of the unit cube by\ntrees of rational complexes.

For this purpose, we relate each level\nof the hierarchy with decidable varieties of languages, which can be defined in\nterms of iterated deterministic and co-deterministic products.

Several years ago the pioneering works of T. Asano, J. Matousek and\nT. Tokuyama introduced \"implicit computational geometry\", in which the\ngeometric objects are defined by implicit relations involving sets. An\nimportant member in this family is called \"a zone diagram\". The implicit nature\nof zone diagrams implies, as already observed in the original works, that their\ncomputation is a challenging task. In a continuous setting this task has been\naddressed (briefly) only by these authors in the Euclidean plane with point\nsites. We discuss the possibility to compute zone diagrams in a wide class of\nspaces and also shed new light on their computation in the original setting.\nThe class of spaces, which is introduced here, includes, in particular,\nEuclidean spheres and finite dimensional strictly convex normed spaces. Sites\nof a general form are allowed and it is shown that a generalization of the\niterative method suggested by Asano, Matousek and Tokuyama converges to a\ndouble zone diagram, another implicit geometric object whose existence is known\nin general. Occasionally a zone diagram can be obtained from this procedure.\nThe actual (approximate) computation of the iterations is based on a simple\nalgorithm which enables the approximate computation of Voronoi diagrams in a\ngeneral setting. Our analysis also yields a few byproducts of independent\ninterest, such as certain topological properties of Voronoi cells (e.g., that\nin the considered setting their boundaries cannot be \"fat\").

Under a path-loss dominated model, we study the\nresource requirements of consensus with respect to three wireless-appropriate\nmetrics: total transmit energy, elapsed time, and time-bandwidth product. First\nwe characterize the performance of several popular gossip algorithms, showing\nthat they may be order-optimal with respect to transmit energy but are strictly\nsuboptimal with respect to elapsed time and time-bandwidth product. Further, we\npropose a new consensus scheme, termed hierarchical averaging, and show that it\nis nearly order-optimal with respect to all three metrics.

Each data stream is formed by error-correction\nencoding, constellation mapping, replication and permutation of symbols, and\napplication of signature sequences. The relations between the data bits and\nmodulation symbols transmitted over the channel can be represented by a sparse\ngraph. In the case where the modulated data streams are transmitted with time\noffsets the receiver observes spatial coupling of the individual graphs into a\ngraph chain enabling efficient demodulation/decoding. We prove that a two-stage\ndemodulation/decoding method, in which iterative demodulation based on symbol\nestimation and interference cancellation is followed by parallel error\ncorrection decoding, achieves capacity on the additive white Gaussian noise\n(AWGN) channel asymptotically. We compare the performance of the two-stage\nreceiver to the receiver which utilizes hard feedback between the\nerror-correction encoders and the iterative demodulator.

This paper focuses on group model selection in high-dimensional linear\nmodels, in which the number of predictors far exceeds the number of samples of\nthe response variable. Existing works on high-dimensional group model selection\neither require the number of samples of the response variable to be\nsignificantly larger than the total number of predictors contributing to the\nresponse or impose restrictive statistical priors on the predictors and/or\nnonzero regression coefficients. This paper provides comprehensive\nunderstanding of a low-complexity approach to group model selection that avoids\nsome of these limitations. The proposed approach, termed Group Thresholding\n(GroTh), is based on thresholding of marginal correlations of groups of\npredictors with the response variable and is reminiscent of existing\nthresholding-based approaches in the literature. The most important\ncontribution of the paper in this regard is relating the performance of GroTh\nto a polynomial-time verifiable property of the predictors for the general case\nof arbitrary (random or deterministic) predictors and arbitrary nonzero\nregression coefficients.

In particular, this strategy\nitself is pretty simple and easy to implement. Furthermore, motivated by the\ncost analysis, we further optimize our solution. The optimizations are mainly\nbased on two insights: (\\romannumeral 1) the number of \\textit{effective\nsubdivision}s is no more than 1; and (\\romannumeral 2) an entity with the\nlarger \\textit{span} is more likely to subdivide a single region.

Let $s$ and $l$ denote the starting point and\nmaximum path length of the moving object $\\mathscr M$, respectively. Given a\npoint $p$ in ${R}^2$, we say the point $p$ is achievable for $\\mathscr M$ such\nthat $\\pi(s,p)\\leq l$, where $\\pi(\\cdot)$ denotes the shortest path length in\nthe presence of obstacles. One is to find a region $\\mathscr R$ such that, for\nany point $p\\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, if it is achievable for $\\mathscr M$, then $p\\in\n\\mathscr R$; otherwise, $p\\notin \\mathscr R$. In this paper, we restrict our\nattention to the case of line-segment obstacles. To tackle this problem, we\ndevelop three algorithms. We first present a simpler-version algorithm for the\nsake of intuition. Its basic idea is to reduce our problem to computing the\nunion of a set of circular visibility regions (CVRs). This algorithm takes\n$O(n^3)$ time. By analysing its dominant steps, we break through its bottleneck\nby using the short path map (SPM) technique to obtain those circles\n(unavailable beforehand), yielding an $O(n^2\\log n)$ algorithm. Owing to the\nfinding above, the third algorithm also uses the SPM technique. It however,\ndoes not continue to construct the CVRs. Instead, it directly traverses each\nregion of the SPM to trace the boundaries, the final algorithm obtains $O(n\\log\nn)$ complexity.

Although this theory\ntypically leads to exponential time algorithms, very little is known about how\nthese algorithms perform in \"typical\" scenarios, or how far the best known\ntheoretical bounds are from the real worst-case scenarios. Here we study the\ncombinatorial and algebraic complexity of normal surfaces from both the\ntheoretical and experimental viewpoints. Theoretically, we obtain new\nexponential lower bounds on the worst-case complexities in a variety of\nsettings that are important for practical computation. Experimentally, we study\nthe worst-case and average-case complexities over a comprehensive body of\nroughly three billion input triangulations. Many of our lower bounds are the\nfirst known exponential lower bounds in these settings, and experimental\nevidence suggests that many of our theoretical lower bounds on worst-case\ngrowth rates may indeed be asymptotically tight.

We make\nthe structural assumption that the two vectors are members of known subspaces,\none with dimension $N$ and the other with dimension $K$. Although the observed\nconvolution is nonlinear in both $\\boldsymbol{w}$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}$, it is\nlinear in the rank-1 matrix formed by their outer product\n$\\boldsymbol{w}\\boldsymbol{x}^*$. This observation allows us to recast the\ndeconvolution problem as low-rank matrix recovery problem from linear\nmeasurements, whose natural convex relaxation is a nuclear norm minimization\nprogram.\n  We prove the effectiveness of this relaxation by showing that for \"generic\"\nsignals, the program can deconvolve $\\boldsymbol{w}$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}$\nexactly when the maximum of $N$ and $K$ is almost on the order of $L$. That is,\nwe show that if $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is drawn from a random subspace of dimension\n$N$, and $\\boldsymbol{w}$ is a vector in a subspace of dimension $K$ whose\nbasis vectors are \"spread out\" in the frequency domain, then nuclear norm\nminimization recovers $\\boldsymbol{w}\\boldsymbol{x}^*$ without error.\n  We discuss this result in the context of blind channel estimation in\ncommunications. If we have a message of length $N$ which we code using a random\n$L\\times N$ coding matrix, and the encoded message travels through an unknown\nlinear time-invariant channel of maximum length $K$, then the receiver can\nrecover both the channel response and the message when $L\\gtrsim N+K$, to\nwithin constant and log factors.

So NNF\ncircuit family cannot compute sandwich structure effectively (Sandwich\nstructure is two accept inputs that sandwich reject inputs in Hamming space).\nNNF circuit have to use unique AND-gate to identify each different vector of\nsandwich structure. That is, we can measure problem complexity by counting\ndifferent vectors.\n  Some decision problem have characteristic in sandwich structure. Different\nvectors of Negate HornSAT problem are at most constant length because we can\ndelete constant part of each negative literal in Horn clauses by using definite\nclauses. Therefore, number of these different vector is at most polynomial\nsize. The other hand, we can design high complexity problem with almost perfct\nnonlinear (APN) function.

In this\npaper, we explain the background to the project and demonstrate an Isabelle\nproof of the theorem \"No inertial observer can travel faster than light\".\n  This approach to physical theories and physical computability has several\npay-offs: (a) we can be certain our intuition hasn't led us astray (or if it\nhas, we can identify where this has happened); (b) we can identify which axioms\nare specifically required in the proof of each theorem and to what extent those\naxioms can be weakened (the fewer assumptions we make up-front, the stronger\nthe results); and (c) we can identify whether new formal proof techniques and\ntactics are needed when tackling physical as opposed to mathematical theories.

Here we consider a special case wideband signal where two or\nmore delayed copies of the same signal are transmitted over the same frequency\nand bandwidth, with the result that ISM dispersion and scattering cancel out\nduring the detection stage. Such a signal is both a good beacon (easy to find)\nand carries arbitrarily large information rate (limited only by the atmospheric\ntransparency to about 10 GHz). The discovery process uses an autocorrelation\nalgorithm, and we outline a compute scheme where the beacon discovery search\ncan be accomplished with only 2x the processing of a conventional sine wave\nsearch, and discuss signal to background response for sighting the beacon. Once\nthe beacon is discovered, the focus turns to information extraction.\nInformation extraction requires similar processing as for generic wideband\nsignal searches, but since we have already identified the beacon, the\nefficiency of information extraction is negligible.

The theory of\nalgorithms for computing 2D Euclidean Voronoi diagrams of point sites is rich\nand useful, with several different and important algorithms. However, this\ntheory has been quite steady during the last few decades in the sense that no\nessentially new algorithms have entered the game. In addition, most of the\nknown algorithms are serial in nature and hence cast inherent difficulties on\nthe possibility to compute the diagram in parallel.

The goal in this paper is to develop a\ngeneral purpose (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence\n(AI) framework to address these challenges. This serves two potential\nfunctions: 1) a simulation environment for exploring various healthcare\npolicies, payment methodologies, etc., and 2) the basis for clinical artificial\nintelligence - an AI that can think like a doctor. This approach combines\nMarkov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical\ndata and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential\ndecision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic\ninteractions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in\npartially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data)\nby maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an\nonline agent that plans and re-plans. This framework was evaluated using real\npatient data from an electronic health record. Such an AI framework easily\noutperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service\nmodels of healthcare (Cost per Unit Change: $189 vs. $497) while obtaining a\n30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain model parameters further\nenhances this advantage, obtaining roughly 50% more improvement for roughly\nhalf the costs. Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation\nframework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain\nenvironments. Future work is described that outlines potential lines of\nresearch and integration of machine learning algorithms for personalized\nmedicine.

First we summarize briefly the Version 2 (published in\nFrench), whose the main characteristics are: 1) A network connected to its\nenvironment is considered as immersed into an information field created by this\nenvironment which so dictates to it the learning constraints. 2) The used\nformalism draws one's inspiration from the one of the Quantum field theory\n(Principle of stationary action, gauge fields, invariance by symmetry\ntransformations,...). 3) We obtain Lagrange equations whose solutions describe\nthe network evolution during the whole learning period. 4) Then, while\nproceeding with the same formalism inspiration, we suggest other study ways\ncapable of evolving the knowledge in the considered scope. In a second part,\nafter a reminder of the points to be improved, we exhibit the Version 5 which\nbrings, we think, relevant improvements. Indeed: 5) We consider the weighted\naverages of the variables; this introduces probabilities. 6) We define two\nobservables (L average of information flux and A activity of the network) which\ncould be measured and so be compared with experimental results. 7) We find that\nL , weighted average of information flows, is an invariant. 8) Finally, we\npropose two expressions for the conactance, from which we deduce the\ncorresponding Lagrange equations which have to be solved to know the evolution\nof the considered weighted averages. But, at the present stage, we think that\nwe can progress only by carrying out experiments (see projects like Human brain\nproject) and discovering invariants, symmetries which would allow us, like in\nPhysics, to classify networks and above all to understand better the\nconnections between them. Indeed, and that is what we propose among the future\nresearch ways, the underlying problem is to understand how, after their\nlearning period, several networks can connect together to produce, in the brain\ncase for instance, what we call mental states.

In this paper, we argue that the\nimproved accuracy achieved by the DNNs is the result of their ability to\nextract discriminative internal representations that are robust to the many\nsources of variability in speech signals. We show that these representations\nbecome increasingly insensitive to small perturbations in the input with\nincreasing network depth, which leads to better speech recognition performance\nwith deeper networks. We also show that DNNs cannot extrapolate to test samples\nthat are substantially different from the training examples. If the training\ndata are sufficiently representative, however, internal features learned by the\nDNN are relatively stable with respect to speaker differences, bandwidth\ndifferences, and environment distortion. This enables DNN-based recognizers to\nperform as well or better than state-of-the-art systems based on GMMs or\nshallow networks without the need for explicit model adaptation or feature\nnormalization.

The key idea of the tree-based solution\nmethod is to associate such recursions with infinite labelled trees in a\nnatural way so that the solution to the recursions solves a counting question\nrelating to the corresponding trees. We characterize certain recursion families\nwithin R(n) by introducing \"simultaneous parameters\" that appear both within\nthe recursion itself and that also specify structural properties of the\ncorresponding tree. First, we extend and unify recently discovered results\nconcerning two families of arity k=2, order p=1 recursions. Next, we\ninvestigate the solution of nested recursion families by taking linear\ncombinations of solution sequence frequencies for simpler nested recursions,\nwhich correspond to superpositions of the associated trees; this leads us to\nidentify and solve two new recursion families for arity k=2 and general order\np. Finally, we extend these results to general arity k>2. We conclude with\nseveral related open problems.

Based on the received data, the\nfusion center formulates a matrix which is then used for target parameter\nestimation. When the receive antennas sample the target returns at Nyquist\nrate, and assuming that there are more receive antennas than targets, the data\nmatrix at the fusion center is low-rank. When each receive antenna sends to the\nfusion center only a small number of samples, along with the sample index, the\nreceive data matrix has missing elements, corresponding to the samples that\nwere not forwarded. Under certain conditions, matrix completion techniques can\nbe applied to recover the full receive data matrix, which can then be used in\nconjunction with array processing techniques, e.g., MUSIC, to obtain target\ninformation. Numerical results indicate that good target recovery can be\nachieved with occupancy of the receive data matrix as low as 50%.

The clients do not communicate with each other and would like to\nverify the correctness of the remote computation and the consistency of the\nserver's responses. This paper presents the Conflict-free Operation\nverification Protocol (COP) that ensures linearizability when the server is\ncorrect and preserves fork-linearizability in any other case. All clients that\nobserve each other's operations are consistent, in the sense that their own\noperations and those operations of other clients that they see are\nlinearizable. If the server forks two clients by hiding an operation, these\nclients never again see operations of each other. COP supports wait-free client\noperations in the sense that when executed with a correct server,\nnon-conflicting operations can run without waiting for other clients, allowing\nmore parallelism than earlier protocols. A conflict arises when an operation\ncauses a subsequent operation to produce a different output value for the\nclient who runs it. The paper gives a precise model for the guarantees of COP\nand includes a formal analysis that these are achieved.

The\nscheme applies a discrete Gaussian distribution over an AWGN-good lattice, but\notherwise does not require a shaping lattice or dither. Thus, it significantly\nsimplifies the default lattice coding scheme of Erez and Zamir which involves a\nquantization-good lattice as well as an AWGN-good lattice. Using the flatness\nfactor, we show that the error probability of the proposed scheme under minimum\nmean-square error (MMSE) lattice decoding is almost the same as that of Erez\nand Zamir, for any rate up to the AWGN channel capacity. We introduce the\nnotion of good constellations, which carry almost the same mutual information\nas that of continuous Gaussian inputs.

The first one is concerning the use of this algorithm in detecting\nsome instances of the classical global common subexpressions, and the second is\nconcerning its use in the detection of some redundancies that a local value\nnumbering algorithm will detect.

Yanofsky\n(2003) in which the existence of a (diagonolized-out and contradictory) object\nimplies the existence of a fixed-point for a certain function. It was shown\nthat many self-referential paradoxes and diagonally proved theorems can fit in\nthat schema. Here, we fit more theorems in the universal schema of\ndiagonalization, such as Euclid's theorem on the infinitude of the primes and\nnew proofs of Boolos (1997) for Cantor's theorem on the non-equinumerosity of a\nset with its powerset. Then, in Linear Temporal Logic, we show the\nnon-existence of a fixed-point in this logic whose proof resembles the argument\nof Yablo's paradox. Thus, Yablo's paradox turns for the first time into a\ngenuine mathematico-logical theorem in the framework of Linear Temporal Logic.\nAgain the diagonal schema of the paper is used in this proof, and also it is\nshown that G.

For a subset $D$ of the image of\n$\\varphi$,$\\hat{\\varphi}$ is called to be injective w.r.t. $D$-uniformity if\nthe distribution of elements of $D$ in the compressed sequence implies all\ninformation of the original primitive sequence. In this correspondence, for at\nleast $1-2(p-1)/(p^n-1)$ of primitive polynomials of degree $n$, a clear\ncriterion on $\\varphi$ is obtained to decide whether $\\hat{\\varphi}$ is\ninjective w.r.t. $D$-uniformity, and the majority of maps on $Z/p^eZ$ induce\ninjective maps on $G'(\\sigma(x),p^e)$. Furthermore, a sufficient condition on\n$\\varphi$ is given to ensure injectivity of $\\hat{\\varphi}$ w.r.t.\n$D$-uniformity. It follows from the sufficient condition that if $\\sigma(x)$ is\nstrongly primitive and the compressing map $\\varphi(x)=f(x_{e-1})$, where\n$f(x_{e-1})$ is a permutation polynomial over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$, then\n$\\hat{\\varphi}$ is injective w.r.t. $D$-uniformity for $\\emptyset\\neq\nD\\subset\\mathbb{F}_{p}$. Moreover, we give three specific families of\ncompressing maps which induce injective maps on $G'(\\sigma(x),p^e)$.

Oftentimes the object of interest is a relatively small subgraph\nin an enormous, potentially uninteresting background. This aspect characterizes\nnetwork detection as a \"big data\" problem. Graph partitioning and network\ndiscovery have been major research areas over the last ten years, driven by\ninterest in internet search, cyber security, social networks, and criminal or\nterrorist activities. The specific problem of network discovery is addressed as\na special case of graph partitioning in which membership in a small subgraph of\ninterest must be determined. Algebraic graph theory is used as the basis to\nanalyze and compare different network detection methods. A new Bayesian network\ndetection framework is introduced that partitions the graph based on prior\ninformation and direct observations. The new approach, called space-time threat\npropagation, is proved to maximize the probability of detection and is\ntherefore optimum in the Neyman-Pearson sense. This optimality criterion is\ncompared to spectral community detection approaches which divide the global\ngraph into subsets or communities with optimal connectivity properties.

However, such matchings are known to be NP-hard to\ncompute on 3-manifolds, through a reduction to the erasability problem.\n  Here, we refine the study of the complexity of problems related to discrete\nMorse theory in terms of parameterized complexity. On the one hand we prove\nthat the erasability problem is W[P]-complete on the natural parameter. On the\nother hand we propose an algorithm for computing optimal Morse matchings on\ntriangulations of 3-manifolds which is fixed-parameter tractable in the\ntreewidth of the bipartite graph representing the adjacency of the 1- and\n2-simplexes. This algorithm also shows fixed parameter tractability for\nproblems such as erasability and maximum alternating cycle-free matching. We\nfurther show that these results are also true when the treewidth of the dual\ngraph of the triangulated 3-manifold is bounded. Finally, we investigate the\nrespective treewidths of simplicial and generalized triangulations of\n3-manifolds.

Analogously, for a linear order L there is\nthe class of L-automatic structures. In this paper we prove the following\nlimitations on the class of L-automatic structures for a fixed L of finite\ncondensation rank 1+\\alpha. Firstly, no scattered linear order with finite\ncondensation rank above \\omega^(\\alpha+1) is L-\\alpha-automatic. In particular,\nevery L-automatic ordinal is below \\omega^\\omega^(\\alpha+1).

In the case of the first order term, we derive an\nobjective function that measures both the stability and informativeness of a\ngiven spectral signature. By optimizing this objective, we design new spectral\nnode signatures tuned to a specific graph to be matched. We also introduce the\npairwise heat kernel distance as a stable second order compatibility term; we\njustify its plausibility by showing that in a certain limiting case it\nconverges to the classical adjacency matrix-based second order compatibility\nfunction.

We show\nthat when there are two (or more) goods, _simple mechanisms_ -- such as selling\nthe goods separately or as a bundle -- _may yield only a negligible fraction of\nthe optimal revenue_. This resolves the open problem of Briest, Chawla,\nKleinberg, and Weinberg (JET 2015) who prove the result for at least three\ngoods in the related setup of a unit-demand buyer. We also introduce the menu\nsize as a simple measure of the complexity of mechanisms, and show that the\nrevenue may increase polynomially with _menu size_ and that no bounded menu\nsize can ensure any positive fraction of the optimal revenue. The menu size\nalso turns out to \"pin down\" the revenue properties of deterministic\nmechanisms.

The method is referred to\nas the correlogram for undersampled data. The algorithm partitions the spectrum\ninto a number of segments and estimates the average power within each spectral\nsegment. This method is able to estimate the power spectrum density of a signal\nfrom undersampled data without essentially requiring the signal to be sparse.\nWe derive the bias and the variance of the spectrum estimator, and show that\nthere is a tradeoff between the accuracy of the estimation, the frequency\nresolution, and the complexity of the estimator. A closed-form approximation of\nthe estimation variance is also derived, which clearly shows how the variance\nis related to different parameters. The asymptotic behavior of the estimator is\nalso investigated, and it is proved that this spectrum estimator is consistent.\nMoreover, the estimation made for different spectral segments becomes\nuncorrelated as the signal length tends to infinity. Finally, numerical\nexamples and simulation results are provided, which approve the theoretical\nconclusions. Comment: 28 pages, 6 figures, submitted to the IEEE Trans.

Furthermore, there are a number of issues that might bias\nprevious studies in the field. In this work, we fill in the gap by introducing\nan empirical methodology that systematically evaluates the performance of a VDM\nin two aspects: quality and predictability. We further apply this methodology\nto assess existing VDMs. The results show that some models should be rejected\noutright, while some others might be adequate to capture the discovery process\nof vulnerabilities. We also consider different usage scenarios of VDMs and find\nthat the simplest linear model is the most appropriate choice in terms of both\nquality and predictability when browsers are young.

To that end, we quantify how the mutual information varies when the\nnumber of antennas (at either the receiver or transmitter side) is altered. For\na system comprising $R$ receive and $T$ transmit antennas with $R>T$, we find\nthe following: By removing as many receive antennas as needed to obtain a\nsquare system (provided the channel matrices before and after the removal have\nfull rank) the maximum resulting loss of mutual information over all\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) depends only on $R$, $T$ and the matrix of\nleft-singular vectors of the initial channel matrix, but not on its singular\nvalues. In particular, if the latter matrix is Haar distributed the ergodic\nrate loss is given by $\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\sum_{r=T+1}^{R}\\frac{1}{r-t}$ nats. Under\nthe same assumption, if $T,R\\to \\infty$ with the ratio $\\phi\\triangleq T/R$\nfixed, the rate loss normalized by $R$ converges almost surely to $H(\\phi)$\nbits with $H(\\cdot)$ denoting the binary entropy function. We also quantify and\nstudy how the mutual information as a function of the system dimensions\ndeviates from the traditionally assumed linear growth in the minimum of the\nsystem dimensions at high SNR.

Combining data from the entirety of arXiv and\nthe Web of Science (WoS), this paper investigates (a) the proportion of papers\nacross all disciplines that are on arXiv and the proportion of arXiv papers\nthat are in the WoS, (b) elapsed time between arXiv submission and journal\npublication, and (c) the aging characteristics and scientific impact of arXiv\ne-prints and their published version. It shows that the proportion of WoS\npapers found on arXiv varies across the specialties of physics and mathematics,\nand that only a few specialties make extensive use of the repository. Elapsed\ntime between arXiv submission and journal publication has shortened but remains\nlonger in mathematics than in physics. In physics, mathematics, as well as in\nastronomy and astrophysics, arXiv versions are cited more promptly and decay\nfaster than WoS papers. The arXiv versions of papers - both published and\nunpublished - have lower citation rates than published papers, although there\nis almost no difference in the impact of the arXiv versions of both published\nand unpublished papers.

The paper also determines which type of\nlinear time notions permit full learnability for learning in the limit of\nautomatic classes (families of languages which are uniformly recognised by a\nfinite automaton). In particular it is shown that a function is automatic iff\nthere is a one-tape Turing machine with a left end which computes the function\nin linear time where the input before the computation and the output after the\ncomputation both start at the left end. It is known that learners realised as\nautomatic update functions are restrictive for learning. In the present work it\nis shown that one can overcome the problem by providing work tapes additional\nto a resource-bounded base tape while keeping the update-time to be linear in\nthe length of the largest datum seen so far. In this model, one additional such\nwork tape provides additional learning power over the automatic learner model\nand two additional work tapes give full learning power. Furthermore, one can\nalso consider additional queues or additional stacks in place of additional\nwork tapes and for these devices, one queue or two stacks are sufficient for\nfull learning power while one stack is insufficient.

However, the resampling\nprocedure used in the particle PHD filter can cause sample impoverishment. To\nrejuvenate the diversity of particles, two easy-to-implement roughening\napproaches are presented to enhance the particle PHD filter. One termed as\n\"separate-roughening\" is inspired by Gordon's roughening procedure that is\napplied on the resampled particles. Another termed as \"direct-roughening\" is\nimplemented by increasing the simulation noise of the state propagation of\nparticles. Four proposals are presented to customize the roughening approach.\nSimulations are presented showing that the roughening approach can benefit the\nparticle PHD filter, especially when the sample size is small.

By transferring the concept of configurations in combinatorial designs\nto the level of Latin squares, we thoroughly investigate the occurrence and\navoidance of stopping sets for the arising codes. Stopping sets are known to\ndetermine the decoding performance over the binary erasure channel and should\nbe avoided for small sizes. Based on large sets of simple-structured MOLS, we\nderive powerful constraints for the choice of suitable subsets, leading to\nimproved stopping set distributions for the corresponding codes. We focus on\nLDPC codes with column weight 4, but the results are also applicable for the\nconstruction of codes with higher column weights.

Many researchers utilise ground truth (GT) in experiments\nand more often than not this GT is derived from one annotator's opinion. How\ndoes the difference in opinion affect an algorithm's evaluation? Four examples\nof typical CV problems are chosen, and a methodology is applied to each to\nquantify the inter-annotator variance and to offer insight into the mechanisms\nbehind agreement and the use of GT. It is found that when detecting linear\nobjects annotator agreement is very low. The agreement in object position,\nlinear or otherwise, can be partially explained through basic image properties.\nAutomatic object detectors are compared to annotator agreement and it is found\nthat a clear relationship exists. Several methods for calculating GTs from a\nnumber of annotations are applied and the resulting differences in the\nperformance of the object detectors are quantified. It is found that the rank\nof a detector is highly dependent upon the method used to form the GT. It is\nalso found that although the STAPLE and LSML GT estimation methods appear to\nrepresent the mean of the performance measured using the individual\nannotations, when there are few annotations, or there is a large variance in\nthem, these estimates tend to degrade. Furthermore, one of the most commonly\nadopted annotation combination methods--consensus voting--accentuates more\nobvious features, which results in an overestimation of the algorithm's\nperformance.

This periodicity solution concept\nyields new insight into non-trivial games. In mixed strategy strategic form\ngames, periodic solutions yield values for the utility function of each player\nthat are equal to the Nash equilibrium ones. In contrast to the Nash\nstrategies, here the payoffs of each player are robust against what the\nopponent plays. Sometimes, periodicity strategies yield higher utilities, and\nsometimes the Nash strategies do, but often the utilities of these two\nstrategies coincide. We formally define and study periodic strategies in two\nplayer perfect information strategic form games with pure strategies and we\nprove that every non-trivial finite game has at least one periodic strategy,\nwith non-trivial meaning non-degenerate payoffs. In some classes of games where\nmixed strategies are used, we identify quantitative features. Particularly\ninteresting are the implications for collective action games, since there the\ncollective action strategy can be incorporated in a purely non-cooperative\ncontext.

We address this lack by providing a general drift\ntheorem that includes bounds on the upper and lower tail of the hitting time\ndistribution. The new tail bounds are applied to prove very precise\nsharp-concentration results on the running time of a simple EA on standard\nbenchmark problems, including the class of general linear functions.\nSurprisingly, the probability of deviating by an $r$-factor in lower order\nterms of the expected time decreases exponentially with $r$ on all these\nproblems. The usefulness of the theorem outside the theory of RSHs is\ndemonstrated by deriving tail bounds on the number of cycles in random\npermutations. All these results handle a position-dependent (variable) drift\nthat was not covered by previous drift theorems with tail bounds. Moreover, our\ntheorem can be specialized into virtually all existing drift theorems with\ndrift towards the target from the literature.

The most characteristic examples of such systems are\nthe volunteer computing and the crowdsourcing platforms. In both examples end\nusers are offering over the Internet their computing power or their human\nintelligence to solve tasks either voluntarily or under payment. While the main\nadvantage of these systems is the inexpensive computational power provided, the\nmain drawback is the untrustworthy nature of the end users. Generally, this\ntype of systems are modeled under the \"master-worker\" setting. A \"master\" has a\nset of tasks to compute and instead of computing them locally she sends these\ntasks to available \"workers\" that compute and report back the task results. We\ncategorize these workers in three generic types: altruistic, malicious and\nrational. Altruistic workers that always return the correct result, malicious\nworkers that always return an incorrect result, and rational workers that\ndecide to reply or not truthfully depending on what increases their benefit. We\ndesign a reinforcement learning mechanism to induce a correct behavior to\nrational workers, while the mechanism is complemented by four reputation\nschemes that cope with malice. The goal of the mechanism is to reach a state of\neventual correctness, that is, a stable state of the system in which the master\nalways obtains the correct task results. Analysis of the system gives provable\nguarantees under which truthful behavior can be ensured. Finally, we observe\nthe behavior of the mechanism through simulations that use realistic system\nparameters values.

This\nextends the energy detector to allow for detecting transmission opportunities\neven if the band is already energy filled. We show that the task described\nabove is not performed efficiently by regular MIMO decoders (such as MMSE\ndecoder) due to possible sparsity in the transmit signal. Since CS\nreconstruction tools take into account the sparsity order of the signal, they\nare more efficient in detecting the activity of the users. Building on\nsuccessful activity detection by the CS detector, we show that the use of a\nCS-aided MMSE decoders yields better performance rather than using either\nCS-based or MMSE decoders separately. Simulations are conducted to verify the\ngains from using CS detector for Primary user activity detection and the\nperformance gain in using CS-aided MMSE decoders for decoding the PU\ninformation for future relaying.

Its early detection helps making therapeutic\ndecision. There is no standard technique or procedure yet which is full-proof\nin predicting cancer class. The genomic level changes can be detected in gene\nexpression data and those changes may serve as standard model for any random\ncancer data for class prediction. Various techniques were implied on prostate\ncancer data set in order to accurately predict cancer class including machine\nlearning techniques. Huge number of attributes and few number of sample in\nmicroarray data leads to poor machine learning, therefore the most challenging\npart is attribute reduction or non significant gene reduction. In this work we\nhave compared several machine learning techniques for their accuracy in\npredicting the cancer class. Machine learning is effective when number of\nattributes (genes) are larger than the number of samples which is rarely\npossible with gene expression data. Attribute reduction or gene filtering is\nabsolutely required in order to make the data more meaningful as most of the\ngenes do not participate in tumor development and are irrelevant for cancer\nprediction. Here we have applied combination of statistical techniques such as\ninter-quartile range and t-test, which has been effective in filtering\nsignificant genes and minimizing noise from data. Further we have done a\ncomprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art machine learning techniques\nfor their accuracy in class prediction of prostate cancer. Out of these\ntechniques, Bayes Network out performed with an accuracy of 94.11% followed by\nNavie Bayes with an accuracy of 91.17%. To cross validate our results, we\nmodified our training dataset in six different way and found that average\nsensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy of Bayes Network is highest\namong all other techniques used.

The CVQKD systems allow an unconditionally\nsecret communication over standard telecommunication networks. To exploit the\nreal potential of CVQKD a robust reconciliation technique is needed. It is\ncurrently unavailable, which makes it impossible to reach the real performance\nof the CVQKD protocols. The reconciliation is a post-processing step separated\nfrom the transmission of quantum states, which is aimed to derive the secret\nkey from the raw data. The reconciliation process of correlated Gaussian\nvariables is a complex problem that requires either tomography in the physical\nlayer that is intractable in a practical scenario, or high-cost calculations in\nthe multidimensional spherical space with strict dimensional limitations. To\navoid these issues we define the low-dimensional reconciliation. We prove that\nthe error probability of one-dimensional reconciliation is zero in any\npractical CVQKD scenario, and provides unconditional security.

Although constructions of\nSTBCs have predominantly matched the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder, design\ncriteria and constructions of full-diversity STBCs have also been reported for\nlow-complexity linear receivers. A new receiver architecture called\nInteger-Forcing (IF) linear receiver has been proposed to MIMO channels by Zhan\net al. which showed promising results for the high-rate V-BLAST encoding\nscheme. In this paper, we address the design of full-diversity STBCs for IF\nlinear receivers. In particular, we are interested in characterizing the\nstructure of STBCs that provide full-diversity with the IF receiver. Along that\ndirection, we derive an upper bound on the probability of decoding error, and\nshow that STBCs that satisfy the restricted non-vanishing singular value (RNVS)\nproperty provide full-diversity for the IF receiver. Furthermore, we prove that\nall known STBCs with the non-vanishing determinant property provide\nfull-diversity with IF receivers, as they guarantee the RNVS property. By using\nthe formulation of RNVS property, we also prove the existence of a\nfull-diversity STBC outside the class of perfect STBCs, thereby adding\nsignificant insights compared to the existing works on STBCs with IF decoding.\nFinally, we present extensive simulation results to demonstrate that linear\ndesigns with RNVS property provide full-diversity for IF receiver.

The signals are multiplexed onto a single line by mixing\neach one against a different code and then adding them together, and the\nresulting signal is sampled at a high rate. We show that if the $M$ signals,\neach bandlimited to $W/2$ Hz, can be approximated by a superposition of $R < M$\nunderlying signals, then the ensemble can be recovered by sampling at a rate\nwithin a logarithmic factor of $RW$ (as compared to the Nyquist rate of $MW$).\nThis sampling theorem shows that the correlation structure of the signal\nensemble can be exploited in the acquisition process even though it is unknown\na priori.\n  The reconstruction of the ensemble is recast as a low-rank matrix recovery\nproblem from linear measurements. The architectures we are considering impose a\ncertain type of structure on the linear operators. Although our results depend\non the mixing forms being random, this imposed structure results in a very\ndifferent type of random projection than those analyzed in the low-rank\nrecovery literature to date. Comment: 38 pages, 11 figures", "1308.6702": "Adversarial hypothesis testing and a quantum Stein's Lemma for\n  restricted measurements,Recall the classical hypothesis testing setting with two convex sets of\nprobability distributions P and Q. One receives either n i.i.d. samples from a\ndistribution p in P or from a distribution q in Q and wants to decide from\nwhich set the points were sampled. It is known that the optimal exponential\nrate at which errors decrease can be achieved by a simple maximum-likelihood\nratio test which does not depend on p or q, but only on the sets P and Q.\n  We consider an adaptive generalization of this model where the choice of p in\nP and q in Q can change in each sample in some way that depends arbitrarily on\nthe previous samples. In other words, in the k'th round, an adversary, having\nobserved all the previous samples in rounds 1,...,k-1, chooses p_k in P and q_k\nin Q, with the goal of confusing the hypothesis test. We prove that even in\nthis case, the optimal exponential error rate can be achieved by a simple\nmaximum-likelihood test that depends only on P and Q.\n  We then show that the adversarial model has applications in hypothesis\ntesting for quantum states using restricted measurements. For example, it can\nbe used to study the problem of distinguishing entangled states from the set of\nall separable states using only measurements that can be implemented with local\noperations and classical communication (LOCC). The basic idea is that in our\nsetup, the deleterious effects of entanglement can be simulated by an adaptive\nclassical adversary.\n  We prove a quantum Stein's Lemma in this setting: In many circumstances, the\noptimal hypothesis testing rate is equal to an appropriate notion of quantum\nrelative entropy between two states. In particular, our arguments yield an\nalternate proof of Li and Winter's recent strengthening of strong subadditivity\nfor quantum relative entropy.

On one side, we present a general\nframework for Bayesian optimization and we compare it with some related fields\nin active learning and Bayesian numerical analysis. On the other hand, Bayesian\noptimization and related problems (bandits, sequential experimental design) are\nhighly dependent on the surrogate model that is selected. However, there is no\nclear standard in the literature. Thus, we present a fast and flexible toolbox\nthat allows to test and combine different models and criteria with little\neffort. It includes most of the state-of-the-art contributions, algorithms and\nmodels. Its speed also removes part of the stigma that Bayesian optimization\nmethods are only good for \"expensive functions\".

One particular challenge for\ninference under linear models is understanding the conditions on the dictionary\nunder which reliable inference is possible. This challenge has attracted\nrenewed attention in recent years since many modern inference problems deal\nwith the \"underdetermined\" setting, in which the number of observations is much\nsmaller than the number of columns in the dictionary. This paper makes several\ncontributions for this setting when the set of observations is given by a\nlinear combination of a small number of groups of columns of the dictionary,\ntermed the \"block-sparse\" case. First, it specifies conditions on the\ndictionary under which most block subdictionaries are well conditioned. This\nresult is fundamentally different from prior work on block-sparse inference\nbecause (i) it provides conditions that can be explicitly computed in\npolynomial time, (ii) the given conditions translate into near-optimal scaling\nof the number of columns of the block subdictionaries as a function of the\nnumber of observations for a large class of dictionaries, and (iii) it suggests\nthat the spectral norm and the quadratic-mean block coherence of the dictionary\n(rather than the worst-case coherences) fundamentally limit the scaling of\ndimensions of the well-conditioned block subdictionaries. Second, this paper\ninvestigates the problems of block-sparse recovery and block-sparse regression\nin underdetermined settings. Near-optimal block-sparse recovery and regression\nare possible for certain dictionaries as long as the dictionary satisfies\neasily computable conditions and the coefficients describing the linear\ncombination of groups of columns can be modeled through a mild statistical\nprior.

However, when it comes to cloud computing\nsystems, the sensitivity of this issue rises, as the clients of system, release\ntheir data to the cloud. XML signature is employed to secure SOAP messages.\nHowever, there are also some weak points that have been identified, named as\nXML signature wrapping attacks, which have been categorized into four major\ngroups; Simple Ancestry Context Attack, Optional element context attacks,\nSibling Value Context Attack, Sibling Order Context. In this paper, two\nexisting methods, for referencing the signed part of SOAP Message, named as ID\nreferencing and XPath method, are analyzed and examined. In addition, a new\nmethod is proposed and tested, to secure the SOAP message.

We show that every combinatorial 4-PPT is stretchable to a geometric\npseudo-triangulation, which in general is not the case if faces may have size\nlarger than 4. Moreover, we prove that the flip graph of combinatorial 4-PPTs\nis connected and has diameter $O(n^2)$, even in the case of labeled vertices\nwith fixed outer face.

Having identified a number of variables\nwhose values can be accessed, there may still be hidden variables which\ninfluence the dynamics of the system. The result is model ambiguity in the\nsense that, for the same (or very similar) input values, different objective\noutputs should have been obtained. In addition, the degree of ambiguity may\nvary widely across the whole range of input values. Thus, to evaluate the\naccuracy of a model it is of utmost importance to create a method to obtain the\ndegree of reliability of each output result. In this paper we present such a\nscheme composed of two coupled artificial neural networks: the first one being\nresponsible for outputting the predicted value, whereas the other evaluates the\nreliability of the output, which is learned from the error values of the first\none. As an illustration, the scheme is applied to a model for tracking slopes\nin a straw chamber and to a credit scoring model.

The goal is for low-complexity encoding and decoding by the\ndesired transmitter-receiver pair, whereas decoding by an eavesdropper is hard\nin terms of prohibitive complexity. The decoding complexity is analyzed by\nmapping the massive MIMO system to a lattice. We show that the eavesdropper's\ndecoder for the MIMO system with M-PAM modulation is equivalent to solving\nstandard lattice problems that are conjectured to be of exponential complexity\nfor both classical and quantum computers. Hence, under the widely-held\nconjecture that standard lattice problems are hard to solve in the worst-case,\nthe proposed encryption scheme has a more robust notion of security than that\nof the most common encryption methods used today such as RSA and\nDiffie-Hellman. Additionally, we show that this scheme could be used to\nsecurely communicate without a pre-shared secret and little computational\noverhead. Thus, by exploiting the physical layer properties of the radio\nchannel, the massive MIMO system provides for low-complexity encryption\ncommensurate with the most sophisticated forms of application-layer encryption\nthat are currently known.

An important special case is when each agent desires at most one good,\nand specifies her (private) value for each good: in this case, the problem is\nexactly the maximum-weight matching problem in a bipartite graph.\n  Private matching and allocation problems have not been considered in the\ndifferential privacy literature, and for good reason: they are plainly\nimpossible to solve under differential privacy. Informally, the allocation must\nmatch agents to their preferred goods in order to maximize social welfare, but\nthis preference is exactly what agents wish to hide. Therefore, we consider the\nproblem under the relaxed constraint of joint differential privacy: for any\nagent i, no coalition of agents excluding i should be able to learn about the\nvaluation function of agent i. In this setting, the full allocation is no\nlonger published---instead, each agent is told what good to get. We first show\nthat with a small number of identical copies of each good, it is possible to\nefficiently and accurately solve the maximum weight matching problem while\nguaranteeing joint differential privacy. We then consider the more general\nallocation problem, when bidder valuations satisfy the gross substitutes\ncondition.

In this paper, we propose a novel communication paradigm to satisfy\nthe performance demands of future wireless networks: a hybrid Cellular/WLAN\nnetwork architecture with wireless offloading. In contrast to the commonly\nadopted practice of WiFi offloading, where the WLAN APs have a wired backhaul\n(e.g., Digital Subscriber Line), we propose a wireless offloading approach,\nwhere the WLAN APs will share their wireless cellular broadband connection with\nother users. These users will select their serving node, i.e., the macro-cell\neNodeB or a WLAN AP, based on a certain selection criterion. Thus a challenging\nresearch field is originated, where interfering effects and wireless resources\nlimitations play a dominant role. Important performance metrics of the proposed\nhybrid scheme, including the bit error probability, the ergodic capacity and\nthe average signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio, are theoretically studied\nand closed form expressions are derived for the single-user case with multiple\ninterferers, for both identical and non-identical fading conditions.

We define its distribution complexity as the largest\n$r$ for which the distribution is not $r$-wise independent ($1 \\le r \\le k$ for\nany distribution with a planted assignment).\n  Our main result is an unconditional lower bound, tight up to logarithmic\nfactors, for statistical (query) algorithms [Kearns 1998, Feldman et. al 2012],\nmatching known upper bounds, which, as we show, can be implemented using a\nstatistical algorithm. Since known approaches for problems over distributions\nhave statistical analogues (spectral, MCMC, gradient-based, convex optimization\netc.), this lower bound provides a rigorous explanation of the observed\nalgorithmic gap. The proof introduces a new general technique for the analysis\nof statistical query algorithms. It also points to a geometric paring\nphenomenon in the space of all planted assignments.\n  We describe consequences of our lower bounds to Feige's refutation hypothesis\n[Feige 2002] and to lower bounds on general convex programs that solve planted\n$k$-SAT. Our bounds also extend to other planted $k$-CSP models, and, in\nparticular, provide concrete evidence for the security of Goldreich's one-way\nfunction and the associated pseudorandom generator when used with a\nsufficiently hard predicate [Goldreich 2000].

While the performance of bandit algorithms with a small\nfinite strategy set is quite well understood, bandit problems with large\nstrategy sets are still a topic of very active investigation, motivated by\npractical applications such as online auctions and web advertisement. The goal\nof such research is to identify broad and natural classes of strategy sets and\npayoff functions which enable the design of efficient solutions.\n  In this work we study a very general setting for the multi-armed bandit\nproblem in which the strategies form a metric space, and the payoff function\nsatisfies a Lipschitz condition with respect to the metric. We refer to this\nproblem as the \"Lipschitz MAB problem\". We present a solution for the\nmulti-armed bandit problem in this setting. That is, for every metric space we\ndefine an isometry invariant which bounds from below the performance of\nLipschitz MAB algorithms for this metric space, and we present an algorithm\nwhich comes arbitrarily close to meeting this bound. Furthermore, our technique\ngives even better results for benign payoff functions. We also address the\nfull-feedback (\"best expert\") version of the problem, where after every round\nthe payoffs from all arms are revealed.

Here\nwe propose the adaptive multicarrier quadrature division-multiuser quadrature\nallocation (AMQD-MQA) multiple access technique for continuous-variable quantum\nkey distribution. The MQA scheme is based on the AMQD modulation, which\ngranulates the inputs of the users into Gaussian subcarrier\ncontinuous-variables (CVs). In an AMQD-MQA multiple access scenario, the\nsimultaneous reliable transmission of the users is handled by the dynamic\nallocation of the Gaussian subcarrier CVs. We propose two different settings of\nAMQD-MQA for multiple input-multiple output communication. We introduce a\nrate-selection strategy that tunes the modulation variances and allocates\nadaptively the quadratures of the users over the sub-channels. We also prove\nthe rate formulas if only partial channel side information is available for the\nusers of the sub-channel conditions. We show a technique for the compensation\nof a nonideal Gaussian input modulation, which allows the users to overwhelm\nthe modulation imperfections to reach optimal capacity-achieving communication\nover the Gaussian sub-channels. We investigate the diversity amplification of\nthe sub-channel transmittance coefficients and reveal that a strong diversity\ncan be exploited by opportunistic Gaussian modulation.

We show that\nAr{\\i}kan's polar transform preserves 'symmetric convex orders'. Furthermore,\nwe show that while for symmetric channels this ordering turns out to be\nequivalent to the stochastic degradation ordering already known to order the\ninformation sets of polar codes, a strictly weaker partial order is obtained\nwhen at least one of the channels is asymmetric. In between, we also discuss\ntwo tools which can be useful for verifying this ordering: a criterion known as\nthe cut criterion and channel symmetrization. Finally, we discuss potential\napplications of the results to polar coding over non-stationary channels.

First, we demonstrate how to\napply machine learning techniques to solve the optimal ordering problem in\nsequential auctions. We learn regression models from historical auctions, which\nare subsequently used to predict the expected value of orderings for new\nauctions. Given the learned models, we propose two types of optimization\nmethods: a black-box best-first search approach, and a novel white-box approach\nthat maps learned models to integer linear programs (ILP) which can then be\nsolved by any ILP-solver. Although the studied auction design problem is hard,\nour proposed optimization methods obtain good orderings with high revenues.\n  Our second main contribution is the insight that the internal structure of\nregression models can be efficiently evaluated inside an ILP solver for\noptimization purposes. To this end, we provide efficient encodings of\nregression trees and linear regression models as ILP constraints. This new way\nof using learned models for optimization is promising. As the experimental\nresults show, it significantly outperforms the black-box best-first search in\nnearly all settings. Comment: 37 pages.

In this paper, we propose a distributed\noptimization algorithm for the channel assignment problem for multiple\ninterfering transceiver pairs that cannot communicate with each other. We first\nmodify the auction algorithm for maximal energy efficiency and show that the\nproblem can be solved without explicit message passing using the carrier sense\nmultiple access (CSMA) protocols. We then develop a novel scheme by converting\nthe channel assignment problem into perfect matchings on bipartite graphs. The\nproposed scheme improves the energy efficiency and does not require any\nexplicit message passing or a shared memory between the users. We derive bounds\non the convergence rate and show that the proposed algorithm converges faster\nthan the distributed auction algorithm and achieves near-optimal performance\nunder Rayleigh fading channels. We also present an asymptotic performance\nanalysis of the fast matching algorithm for energy efficient resource\nallocation and prove the optimality for large enough number of users and number\nof channels. Finally, we provide numerical assessments that confirm the energy\nefficiency gains compared to the state of the art. Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures, 3 Tables.

Such timing channels are\ncommonly studied under the assumption of a work-conserving queue. In contrast,\nthis paper studies the case of a bufferless queue that drops arriving packets\nwhile a packet is in service. Under this bufferless model, the paper provides\nupper bounds on the capacity of timing channels and establishes achievable\nrates for the case of bufferless M/M/1 and M/G/1 queues. In particular, it is\nshown that a bufferless M/M/1 queue at worst suffers less than 10% reduction in\ncapacity when compared to an M/M/1 work-conserving queue.

The algorithm has three aspects: (1) the number of navigation steps\ndoes not exceed 15 (independent of the linkage), (2) each step is a disguised\nflex of a quadrilateral from one triangular configuration to another, which is\na well understood type of flex, and (3) each step can be performed explicitly\nby adding some extra bars and obtaining a mechanism with one degree of freedom.

There are several popular implementations of this method, including\nthe Eigenvector Method, the Least Squares Method, the Chi Squares Method and\nothers. Each of the above methods comes with one or more inconsistency indices\nthat help to decide whether the consistency of input guarantees obtaining a\nreliable output, thus taking the optimal decision. This article explores the\nrelationship between inconsistency of input and discrepancy of output. A global\nranking discrepancy describes to what extent the obtained results correspond to\nthe single expert's assessments. On the basis of the inconsistency and\ndiscrepancy indices, two properties of the weight deriving procedure are\nformulated. These properties are proven for Eigenvector Method and Koczkodaj's\nInconsistency Index. Several estimates using Koczkodaj's Inconsistency Index\nfor a principal eigenvalue, Saaty's inconsistency index and the Condition of\nOrder Preservation are also provided.

This\nmatches the lower bound given by previous constructions. It follows that the\nlargest independent sets given by local algorithms on random d-regular graphs\nhave the same asymptotic density. In contrast, the density of the largest\nindependent sets on these graphs is asymptotically 2(log d)/d. We also prove\nanalogous results for Poisson-Galton-Watson trees, which yield bounds for local\nalgorithms on sparse Erdos-Renyi graphs.

We\npropose a \\textit{generalized signal alignment} (GSA) based transmission\nscheme. The key is to let the signals to be exchanged between every source node\nalign in a transformed subspace, rather than the direct subspace, at the relay\nso as to form network-coded signals. This is realized by jointly designing the\nprecoding matrices at all source nodes and the processing matrix at the relay.\nMoreover, the aligned subspaces are orthogonal to each other. By applying the\nGSA, we show that the DoF upper bound $4M$ is achievable when $M \\leq\n\\lfloor\\frac{2N}{5}\\rfloor$ ($M$ is even) or $M \\leq\n\\lfloor\\frac{2N-1}{5}\\rfloor$ ($M$ is odd). Numerical results also demonstrate\nthat our proposed transmission scheme is feasible and effective.

Currently, the most effective method\nto measure the proteome is with shotgun, or bottom-up, proteomics, in which the\nproteome is digested into peptides that are identified followed by protein\ninference. Despite continuous improvements to all steps of the shotgun\nproteomics workflow, observed proteome coverage is often low; some proteins are\nidentified by a single peptide sequence. Complete proteome sequence coverage\nwould allow comprehensive characterization of RNA splicing variants and all\npost translational modifications, which would drastically improve the accuracy\nof biological models. There are many reasons for the sequence coverage deficit,\nbut ultimately peptide length determines sequence observability. Peptides that\nare too short are lost because they match many protein sequences and their true\norigin is ambiguous. The maximum observable peptide length is determined by\nseveral analytical challenges. This paper explores computationally how peptide\nlengths produced from several common proteome digestion methods limit\nobservable proteome coverage. Iterative proteome cleavage strategies are also\nexplored. These simulations reveal that maximized proteome coverage can be\nachieved by use of an iterative digestion protocol involving multiple proteases\nand chemical cleavages that theoretically allow 91.1% proteome coverage.

In his model, each bank has only two\ncounter-party neighbors, a bank fails due to the counter-party risk only if at\nleast one of its two neighbors default, and such a counter-party risk is a low\nprobability event. Informally, the author shows that the banks will hedge their\nasset risks by appropriate OTC contracts, and, though it may be socially\noptimal to insure against counter-party risk, in equilibrium banks will {\\em\nnot} choose to insure this low probability event.\n  In this paper, we consider the above model for more general network\ntopologies, namely when each node has exactly 2r counter-party neighbors for\nsome integer r>0. We extend the analysis of [1] to show that as the number of\ncounter-party neighbors increase the probability of counter-party risk also\nincreases, and in particular the socially optimal solution becomes privately\nsustainable when each bank hedges its risk to at least n/2 banks, where n is\nthe number of banks in the network, i.e., when 2r is at least n/2, banks not\nonly hedge their asset risk but also hedge its counter-party risk.

In this\ndomain the problem of integrating various Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nalgorithms into a single intelligent system arises spontaneously. As part of\nour ongoing effort in automating media content analysis for the social\nsciences, we have built a modular system by combining multiple AI modules into\na flexible framework in which they can cooperate in complex tasks. Our system\ncombines data gathering, machine translation, topic classification, extraction\nand annotation of entities and social networks, as well as many other tasks\nthat have been perfected over the past years of AI research. Over the last few\nyears, it has allowed us to realise a series of scientific studies over a vast\nrange of applications including comparative studies between news outlets and\nmedia content in different countries, modelling of user preferences, and\nmonitoring public mood. The framework is flexible and allows the design and\nimplementation of modular agents, where simple modules cooperate in the\nannotation of a large dataset without central coordination.

Chailloux and Kerenidis (2009) designed quantum protocols that\nguarantee coin-flips with near optimal bias. The probability of any outcome in\nthese protocols is provably at most $1/\\sqrt{2} + \\delta$ for any given $\\delta\n> 0$. However, no explicit description of these protocols is known, and the\nnumber of rounds in the protocols tends to infinity as $\\delta$ goes to 0. In\nfact, the smallest bias achieved by known explicit protocols is $1/4$\n(Ambainis, 2001).\n  We take a computational optimization approach, based mostly on convex\noptimization, to the search for simple and explicit quantum strong\ncoin-flipping protocols. We present a search algorithm to identify protocols\nwith low bias within a natural class, protocols based on bit-commitment (Nayak\nand Shor, 2003) restricting to commitment states used by Mochon (2005). An\nanalysis of the resulting protocols via semidefinite programs (SDPs) unveils a\nsimple structure. For example, we show that the SDPs reduce to second-order\ncone programs. We devise novel cheating strategies in the protocol by\nrestricting the semidefinite programs and use the strategies to prune the\nsearch.\n  The techniques we develop enable a computational search for protocols given\nby a mesh over the parameter space. The protocols have up to six rounds of\ncommunication, with messages of varying dimension and include the best known\nexplicit protocol (with bias 1/4). We conduct two kinds of search: one for\nprotocols with bias below 0.2499, and one for protocols in the neighbourhood of\nprotocols with bias 1/4. Neither of these searches yields better bias.

Platform diversity, contact\nlist utilization by the malware, clustering in the network structure, etc. can\nalso lead to differing spreading rates. In this paper, a general formal\nframework is proposed for leveraging such heterogeneity to derive optimal\npatching policies that attain the minimum aggregate cost due to the spread of\nmalware and the surcharge of patching. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle for\na stratified epidemic model, it is analytically proven that in the mean-field\ndeterministic regime, optimal patch disseminations are simple single-threshold\npolicies. Through numerical simulations, the behavior of optimal patching\npolicies is investigated in sample topologies and their advantages are\ndemonstrated. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures", "1403.1642": "Optimal Energy-Aware Epidemic Routing in DTNs,In this work, we investigate the use of epidemic routing in energy\nconstrained Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). In epidemic routing, messages are\nrelayed by intermediate nodes at contact opportunities, i.e., when pairs of\nnodes come within the transmission range of each other. Each node needs to\ndecide whether to forward its message upon contact with a new node based on its\nown residual energy level and the age of that message. We mathematically\ncharacterize the fundamental trade-off between energy conservation and a\nmeasure of Quality of Service as a dynamic energy-dependent optimal control\nproblem. We prove that in the mean-field regime, the optimal dynamic forwarding\ndecisions follow simple threshold-based structures in which the forwarding\nthreshold for each node depends on its current remaining energy. We then\ncharacterize the nature of this dependence. Our simulations reveal that the\noptimal dynamic policy significantly outperforms heuristics.

We present a fast new\nprobabilistic algorithm for solving this problem optimally, i.e., for finding\nthe shortest possible circuit whatsoever for the given problem instance. The\nalgorithm requires a factoring oracle (such as a quantum computer). Even in the\nabsence of a factoring oracle, the algorithm is still near-optimal under a mild\nnumber-theoretic hypothesis. In this case, the algorithm finds a solution of\nT-count m + O(log(log(1/epsilon))), where m is the T-count of the\nsecond-to-optimal solution. In the typical case, this yields circuit\napproximations of T-count 3log_2(1/epsilon) + O(log(log(1/epsilon))). Our\nalgorithm is efficient in practice, and provably efficient under the\nabove-mentioned number-theoretic hypothesis, in the sense that its expected\nruntime is O(polylog(1/epsilon)).

This invariant generalizes the one-dimensional notion of\nsuper summit set to arbitrary dimensions.

The complexity of this solution is a small degree polynomial\nin the cardinalities of our generalized super summit sets and the input\nparameters.

Considering a damaged wireless network, presenting coverage\nholes or/and many disconnected components, we propose a disaster recovery\nalgorithm which repairs the network. It provides the list of locations where to\nput new nodes in order to patch the coverage holes and mend the disconnected\ncomponents. In order to do this we first consider the simplicial complex\nrepresentation of the network, then the algorithm adds supplementary vertices\nin excessive number, and afterwards runs a reduction algorithm in order to\nreach an optimal result. One of the novelty of this work resides in the\nproposed method for the addition of vertices. We use a determinantal point\nprocess: the Ginibre point process which has inherent repulsion between\nvertices, and has never been simulated before for wireless networks\nrepresentation. We compare both the determinantal point process addition method\nwith other vertices addition methods, and the whole disaster recovery algorithm\nto the greedy algorithm for the set cover problem.

An Empirical Inquiry into the\n  Redundancy Assumptions of Program Repair Approaches,Much initial research on automatic program repair has focused on experimental\nresults to probe their potential to find patches and reduce development effort.\nRelatively less effort has been put into understanding the hows and whys of\nsuch approaches. For example, a critical assumption of the GenProg technique is\nthat certain bugs can be fixed by copying and re-arranging existing code. In\nother words, GenProg assumes that the fix ingredients already exist elsewhere\nin the code. In this paper, we formalize these assumptions around the concept\nof ''temporal redundancy''. A temporally redundant commit is only composed of\nwhat has already existed in previous commits. Our experiments show that a large\nproportion of commits that add existing code are temporally redundant. This\nvalidates the fundamental redundancy assumption of GenProg. Comment: ICSE - 36th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering\n  (2014)", "1404.1008": "Spectral concentration and greedy k-clustering,A popular graph clustering method is to consider the embedding of an input\ngraph into R^k induced by the first k eigenvectors of its Laplacian, and to\npartition the graph via geometric manipulations on the resulting metric space.\nDespite the practical success of this methodology, there is limited\nunderstanding of several heuristics that follow this framework. We provide\ntheoretical justification for one such natural and computationally efficient\nvariant.\n  Our result can be summarized as follows. A partition of a graph is called\nstrong if each cluster has small external conductance, and large internal\nconductance. We present a simple greedy spectral clustering algorithm which\nreturns a partition that is provably close to a suitably strong partition,\nprovided that such a partition exists. A recent result shows that strong\npartitions exist for graphs with a sufficiently large spectral gap between the\nk-th and (k+1)-st eigenvalues. Taking this together with our main theorem gives\na spectral algorithm which finds a partition close to a strong one for graphs\nwith large enough spectral gap. We also show how this simple greedy algorithm\ncan be implemented in near-linear time for any fixed k and error guarantee.\nFinally, we evaluate our algorithm on some real-world and synthetic inputs. Comment: 21 pages, 6 figures", "1404.1864": "Sublinear algorithms for local graph centrality estimation,We study the complexity of local graph centrality estimation, with the goal\nof approximating the centrality score of a given target node while exploring\nonly a sublinear number of nodes/arcs of the graph and performing a sublinear\nnumber of elementary operations. We develop a technique, that we apply to the\nPageRank and Heat Kernel centralities, for building a low-variance score\nestimator through a local exploration of the graph. We obtain an algorithm\nthat, given any node in any graph of $m$ arcs, with probability $(1-\\delta)$\ncomputes a multiplicative $(1\\pm\\epsilon)$-approximation of its score by\nexamining only $\\tilde{O}(\\min(m^{2/3} \\Delta^{1/3} d^{-2/3},\\, m^{4/5}\nd^{-3/5}))$ nodes/arcs, where $\\Delta$ and $d$ are respectively the maximum and\naverage outdegree of the graph (omitting for readability\n$\\operatorname{poly}(\\epsilon^{-1})$ and $\\operatorname{polylog}(\\delta^{-1})$\nfactors). A similar bound holds for computational complexity. We also prove a\nlower bound of $\\Omega(\\min(m^{1/2} \\Delta^{1/2} d^{-1/2}, \\, m^{2/3}\nd^{-1/3}))$ for both query complexity and computational complexity. Moreover,\nour technique yields a $\\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ query complexity algorithm for the\ngraph access model of [Brautbar et al., 2010], widely used in social network\nmining; we show this algorithm is optimal up to a sublogarithmic factor. These\nare the first algorithms yielding worst-case sublinear bounds for general\ndirected graphs and any choice of the target node.

The answer is somewhat negative, although adaptive fault tolerance\nis antifragile: the system learns something when an error happens, and always\nimrpoves. Automatic runtime bug fixing is changing the code in response to\nerrors, fault injection in production means injecting errors in business\ncritical software.

The recently identified\ncoordinated data injection attacks to meter measurements can bypass the current\nsecurity system and introduce errors to the state estimates. The conventional\nwisdom to mitigate such attacks is by securing meter measurements to evade\nmalicious injections. In this paper, we provide a novel alternative to defend\nagainst false-data injection attacks using covert power network topological\ninformation. By keeping the exact reactance of a set of transmission lines from\nattackers, no false data injection attack can be launched to compromise any set\nof state variables. We first investigate from the attackers' perspective the\nnecessary condition to perform injection attack. Based on the arguments, we\ncharacterize the optimal protection problem, which protects the state variables\nwith minimum cost, as a well-studied Steiner tree problem in a graph. Besides,\nwe also propose a mixed defending strategy that jointly considers the use of\ncovert topological information and secure meter measurements when either method\nalone is costly or unable to achieve the protection objective. A mixed integer\nlinear programming (MILP) formulation is introduced to obtain the optimal mixed\ndefending strategy. To tackle the NP-hardness of the problem, a tree\npruning-based heuristic is further presented to produce an approximate solution\nin polynomial time. The advantageous performance of the proposed defending\nmechanisms is verified in IEEE standard power system testcases.

Certain\ncases of quantum rewinding are handled by the results by Watrous (SIAM J\nComput, 2009) and Unruh (Eurocrypt 2012), yet in general the problem remains\nelusive. We show that this is not only due to a lack of proof techniques:\nrelative to an oracle, we show that classically secure proofs and proofs of\nknowledge are insecure in the quantum setting.\n  More specifically, sigma-protocols, the Fiat-Shamir construction, and\nFischlin's proof system are quantum insecure under assumptions that are\nsufficient for classical security. Additionally, we show that for similar\nreasons, computationally binding commitments provide almost no security\nguarantees in a quantum setting.\n  To show these results, we develop the \"pick-one trick\", a general technique\nthat allows an adversary to find one value satisfying a given predicate, but\nnot two.

By allowing an arbitrary information exchange pattern, the\nconsidered channel model is a unified one. It includes several existing channel\nmodels as special cases: $K$-user MIMO Y channel, multi-pair MIMO two-way relay\nchannel, generalized MIMO two-way X relay channel, and $L$-cluster MIMO\nmultiway relay channel. Previous studies mainly considered the achievability of\nthe DoF cut-set bound $2N$ at the antenna configuration $N < 2M$ by applying\nsignal alignment. This work aims to investigate the achievability of the DoF\ncut-set bound $KM$ for the case $N\\geq 2M$. To this end, we first derive\ntighter DoF upper bounds for three special cases of the considered channel\nmodel. Then, we propose a new transmission framework, generalized signal\nalignment, to approach these bounds. The notion of GSA is to form network-coded\nsymbols by aligning every pair of signals to be exchanged in a compressed\nsubspace at the relay. A necessary and sufficient condition to construct the\nrelay compression matrix is given. We show that using GSA, the new DoF upper\nbound is achievable when i) $\\frac{N}{M} \\in \\big(0, 2+\\frac{4}{K(K-1)}\\big]\n\\cup \\big[K-2, +\\infty\\big)$ for the $K$-user MIMO Y channel; ii) $\\frac{N}{M}\n\\in \\big(0, 2+\\frac{4}{K}\\big] \\cup \\big[K-2, +\\infty\\big)$ for the multi-pair\nMIMO two-way relay channel; iii) $\\frac{N}{M} \\in \\big(0, 2+\\frac{8}{K^2}\\big]\n\\cup \\big[K-2, +\\infty\\big)$ for the generalized MIMO two-way X relay channel.\nWe also provide the antenna configuration regions for the general multi-user\nMIMO two-way relay channel to achieve the total DoF $KM$.

Correspondingly, the arising monad transformer has been termed the\ncoinductive generalized resumption transformer.

Moreover, we provide a\nuniversal characterization of the coinductive resumption monad transformer in\nterms of coproducts of complete Elgot monads.

The result has implications for the compressibility\nand kernelizability of a whole range of NP-complete parameterized problems. We\npresent a streamlined proof of Drucker's theorem.\n  An AND-compression is a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that maps a\nset of SAT-instances $x_1,\\dots,x_t$ to a single SAT-instance $y$ of size\npoly(max $|x_i|$) such that $y$ is satisfiable if and only if all $x_i$ are\nsatisfiable. The \"AND\" in the name stems from the fact that the predicate \"$y$\nis satisfiable\" can be written as the AND of all predicates \"$x_i$ is\nsatisfiable\". Drucker's result complements the result by Bodlaender et al.\n(2009) and Fortnow and Santhanam (2010), who proved the analogous statement for\nOR-compressions, and Drucker's proof not only subsumes that result but also\nextends it to randomized compression algorithms that are allowed to have a\ncertain probability of failure.\n  Drucker (2012) presented two proofs: The first uses information theory and\nthe minimax theorem from game theory, and the second is an elementary,\niterative proof that is not as general. In our proof, we realize the iterative\nstructure as a generalization of the arguments of Ko (1983) for P-selective\nsets, which use the fact that tournaments have dominating sets of logarithmic\nsize. We generalize this fact to hypergraph tournaments. Our proof achieves the\nfull generality of Drucker's theorem, avoids the minimax theorem, and restricts\nthe use of information theory to a single, intuitive lemma about the average\nnoise sensitivity of compressive maps. To prove this lemma, we use the same\ninformation-theoretic inequalities as Drucker.

As a classic estimator based on random matrix theory\n(RMT), the RMT estimator estimates the number of signals via sequentially\ntesting the likelihood of an eigenvalue as arising from a signal or noise for a\ngiven over-detection probability. However, it tends to down-estimate the number\nof signals as weak signal eigenvalues may be immersed in the bias term among\neigenvalues. In order to solve this problem, in this paper we focus on\ndeveloping novel RMT-based estimators by incorporating this bias term into RMT\nestimator. Firstly, we derive a novel decision statistics for signal detection\nby incorporating the bias term into the RMT estimator, and propose a\nsignal-test RMT estimator for signal number estimation for a given\nmiss-detection probability. Secondly, we analyze the effect of the bias term on\nthe detection performance of the signal-test RMT estimator and the RMT\nestimator. It shows that the signal-test RMT estimator has lower\ndown-estimation probability than the RMT estimator when weak signal eigenvalues\nare immersed in the bias term, but has higher over-estimation probability than\nthe RMT estimator when all signals are strong enough to be detected by the RMT\nestimator. Thirdly, we derive analytical formulas for the increased\nover-estimation probability of the signal-test RMT estimator and the increased\ndown-estimation probability of the RMT estimator incurred by this bias term,\nand then propose a signal-noise-test RMT estimator which can adaptively select\nits decision criterion between the RMT estimator and the signal-test RMT\nestimator to make benefits of these two estimators while avoiding their\nindividual drawbacks. Finally, simulation results are presented to show that\nthe proposed signal-noise-test RMT estimator significantly outperforms the\nexisting estimators in all cases.

In\nthe same line, considerable emphasis has been recently given to two apparently\ndisjoint research topics: data-parallel, and eventually consistent, distributed\nsystems. Declarative networking has been recently proposed to ease the task of\nprogramming in the cloud, by allowing the programmer to express only the\ndesired result and leave the implementation details to the responsibility of\nthe run-time system. In this context, we propose a study on a\nlogic-programming-based computational model for eventually consistent,\ndata-parallel systems, the keystone of which is provided by the recent finding\nthat the class of programs that can be computed in an eventually consistent,\ncoordination-free way is that of monotonic programs. This principle is called\nCALM and has been proven by Ameloot et al. for distributed, asynchronous\nsettings. We advocate that CALM should be employed as a basic theoretical tool\nalso for data-parallel systems, wherein computation usually proceeds\nsynchronously in rounds and where communication is assumed to be reliable. It\nis general opinion that coordination-freedom can be seen as a major\ndiscriminant factor. In this work we make the case that the current form of\nCALM does not hold in general for data-parallel systems, and show how, using\nnovel techniques, the satisfiability of the CALM principle can still be\nobtained although just for the subclass of programs called connected monotonic\nqueries. We complete the study with considerations on the relationships between\nour model and the one employed by Ameloot et al., showing that our techniques\nsubsume the latter when the synchronization constraints imposed on the system\nare loosened.

The characterization leads to a proof of what was known\nas the \"runs\" conjecture (Kolpakov \\& Kucherov (FOCS '99)), which states that\nthe maximum number of runs $\\rho(n)$ in a string of length $n$ is less than\n$n$. The proof is remarkably simple, considering the numerous endeavors to\ntackle this problem in the last 15 years, and significantly improves our\nunderstanding of how runs can occur in strings. In addition, we obtain an upper\nbound of $3n$ for the maximum sum of exponents $\\sigma(n)$ of runs in a string\nof length $n$, improving on the best known bound of $4.1n$ by Crochemore et al.\n(JDA 2012), as well as other improved bounds on related problems. The\ncharacterization also gives rise to a new, conceptually simple linear-time\nalgorithm for computing all the runs in a string. A notable characteristic of\nour algorithm is that, unlike all existing linear-time algorithms, it does not\nutilize the Lempel-Ziv factorization of the string. We also establish a\nrelationship between runs and nodes of the Lyndon tree, which gives a simple\noptimal solution to the 2-Period Query problem that was recently solved by\nKociumaka et al.

First,\nI define new elements of Boolean formula such as dominant variable, decision\nchain, and chain coupler. Through the analysis of the SAT problem using the\nelements, I prove that we can construct a k-SAT (k>2) instance where the\ncoefficients of cutting planes take exponentially large values in the input\nsize. This exponential property is caused by the number system formed from the\ncalculation of coefficients. In addition, I show that 2-SAT does not form the\nnumber system and Horn-SAT partially forms the number system according to the\nfeasible value of the dominant variable. Whether or not the coefficients of\ncutting planes in cutting plane proof are polynomially bounded was open\nproblem. Many researchers believed that cutting plane proofs with large\ncoefficients are highly non-intuitive20. However, we can construct a k-SAT\n(k>2) instance in which cutting planes take exponentially large coefficients by\nthe number system. In addition, this exponential property is so strong that it\ngives definite answers for several questions: why Horn-SAT has the intermediate\nproperty between 2-SAT and 3-SAT; why random-SAT is so easy; and why k-SAT\n(k>2) cannot be solved with the linear programming technique. As we know, 2-SAT\nis NL-complete, Horn-SAT is P-complete, and k-SAT (k>2) is NP-complete. In\nterms of computational complexity, this paper gives a clear mathematical\nproperty by which SAT problems in three different classes are distinguished.

Thus, three\nlayers are distinguished: variations in the communications, historical\norganization at each moment of time, and evolutionary self-organization of the\ncodes of communication over time. Furthermore, the codes of communication can\nfunctionally be different and then the system is both horizontally and\nvertically differentiated. All these subdynamics operate in parallel and\nnecessarily generate uncertainty. However, meaningful information can be\nconsidered as the specific selection of a signal from the noise; the codes of\ncommunication are social constructs that can generate redundancy by giving\ndifferent meanings to the same information. Reflexively, one can translate\namong codes in more elaborate discourses. The second (instantiating) layer can\nbe operationalized in terms of semantic maps using the vector space model; the\nthird in terms of mutual redundancy among the latent dimensions of the vector\nspace. Using Blaise Cronin's {\\oe}uvre, the different operations of the three\nlayers are demonstrated empirically. Comment: Pp. 280-303 in: Cassidy R.

In\nparticular, we take the point of view of modern coding theory and discuss how\nrecent advances in coding for symmetric channels help provide more efficient\nsolutions for the asymmetric case. We consider, in more detail, three basic\ncoding paradigms.\n  The first one is Gallager's scheme that consists of concatenating a linear\ncode with a non-linear mapping so that the input distribution can be\nappropriately shaped. We explicitly show that both polar codes and spatially\ncoupled codes can be employed in this scenario. Furthermore, we derive a\nscaling law between the gap to capacity, the cardinality of the input and\noutput alphabets, and the required size of the mapper.\n  The second one is an integrated scheme in which the code is used both for\nsource coding, in order to create codewords distributed according to the\ncapacity-achieving input distribution, and for channel coding, in order to\nprovide error protection. Such a technique has been recently introduced by\nHonda and Yamamoto in the context of polar codes, and we show how to apply it\nalso to the design of sparse graph codes.\n  The third paradigm is based on an idea of B\\\"ocherer and Mathar, and\nseparates the two tasks of source coding and channel coding by a chaining\nconstruction that binds together several codewords. We present conditions for\nthe source code and the channel code, and we describe how to combine any source\ncode with any channel code that fulfill those conditions, in order to provide\ncapacity-achieving schemes for asymmetric channels. In particular, we show that\npolar codes, spatially coupled codes, and homophonic codes are suitable as\nbasic building blocks of the proposed coding strategy.

Our system environment\nconsists of two type of sensors, randomly deployed static sensors and global\npositioning system equipped moving sensors. These moving anchors travels across\nthe network field and broadcast their current locations on specified intervals.\nAs soon as the sensors which are deployed in random fashion receives three\nbeacon messages (known locations broadcasted by anchors), they computes their\nlocations automatically by using our proposed algorithm. One of our significant\ncontributions is, we use only three different beacon messages to localize one\nsensor, while in the best of our knowledge, all previously proposed methods use\nat least four different known locations. The ability of our method to localize\nby using only three known locations not only saves computation, time, energy,\nbut also reduces the number of anchors needed to be deployed and more\nimportantly reduces the communication overheads. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed scheme improves the overall efficiency of\nlocalization process significantly.\n  Important Note: Final version of this paper is accepted and published by\nJournal of Wireless Personal Communication, Springer : June, 2014 The final\nversion of publication is available at link.springer.com Link:\nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007\\%2Fs11277-014-1852-6 Comment: Journal of Wireless Personal Communication, Springer : June, 2014,\n  The final version of publication is available at link.springer.com Link:\n  http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11277-014-1852-6", "1407.1103": "Synchronization of finite-state pulse-coupled oscillators,We propose a novel generalized cellular automaton(GCA) model for\ndiscrete-time pulse-coupled oscillators and study the emergence of synchrony.\nGiven a finite simple graph and an integer $n\\ge 3$, each vertex is an\nidentical oscillator of period $n$ with the following weak coupling along the\nedges: each oscillator inhibits its phase update if it has at least one\nneighboring oscillator at a particular \"blinking\" state and if its state is\nahead of this blinking state.

The crux of their approach is to compute an upper bound on\nthe minimum cost of a circulation in a particular network, $C(G,T)$, where $G$\nis the input graph and $T$ is a carefully chosen spanning tree. The cost of\nthis circulation is directly related to the number of edges in a tour output by\ntheir algorithm. Mucha subsequently improved the analysis of the circulation\ncost, proving that M\\\"omke and Svensson's algorithm for graph-TSP has an\napproximation ratio of at most $13/9$ on general graphs.\n  This analysis of the circulation is local, and vertices with degree four and\nfive can contribute the most to its cost. Thus, hypothetically, there could\nexist a subquartic graph (a graph with degree at most four at each vertex) for\nwhich Mucha's analysis of the M\\\"omke-Svensson algorithm is tight. We show that\nthis is not the case and that M\\\"omke and Svensson's algorithm for graph-TSP\nhas an approximation guarantee of at most $25/18$ on subquartic graphs. To\nprove this, we present different methods to upper bound the minimum cost of a\ncirculation on the network $C(G,T)$. Our approximation guarantee holds for all\ngraphs that have an optimal solution to a standard linear programming\nrelaxation of graph-TSP with subquartic support. Comment: Journal version", "1407.2988": "Proving differential privacy in Hoare logic,Differential privacy is a rigorous, worst-case notion of privacy-preserving\ncomputation. Informally, a probabilistic program is differentially private if\nthe participation of a single individual in the input database has a limited\neffect on the program's distribution on outputs. More technically, differential\nprivacy is a quantitative 2-safety property that bounds the distance between\nthe output distributions of a probabilistic program on adjacent inputs. Like\nmany 2-safety properties, differential privacy lies outside the scope of\ntraditional verification techniques. Existing approaches to enforce privacy are\nbased on intricate, non-conventional type systems, or customized relational\nlogics. These approaches are difficult to implement and often cumbersome to\nuse.\n  We present an alternative approach that verifies differential privacy by\nstandard, non-relational reasoning on non-probabilistic programs. Our approach\ntransforms a probabilistic program into a non-probabilistic program which\nsimulates two executions of the original program. We prove that if the target\nprogram is correct with respect to a Hoare specification, then the original\nprobabilistic program is differentially private. We provide a variety of\nexamples from the differential privacy literature to demonstrate the utility of\nour approach. Finally, we compare our approach with existing verification\ntechniques for privacy.

This class\ncontains several fundamental combinatorial objects as special cases, such as\nplane partitions, tilings of Aztec diamonds, pyramid partitions and more\ngenerally steep domino tilings of the plane. Our algorithm, which is of\npolynomial complexity, is both exact (i.e. the output follows exactly the\ntarget probability law, which is either Boltzmann or uniform in our case), and\nentropy optimal (i.e. it reads a minimal number of random bits as an input).\n  The algorithm encompasses previous growth procedures for special Schur\nprocesses related to the primal and dual RSK algorithm, as well as the famous\ndomino shuffling algorithm for domino tilings of the Aztec diamond. It can be\neasily adapted to deal with symmetric Schur processes and general Schur\nprocesses involving infinitely many parameters. It is more concrete and easier\nto implement than Borodin's algorithm, and it is entropy optimal.\n  At a technical level, it relies on unified bijective proofs of the different\ntypes of Cauchy and Littlewood identities for Schur functions, and on an\nadaptation of Fomin's growth diagram description of the RSK algorithm to that\nsetting. Simulations performed with this algorithm suggest interesting limit\nshape phenomena for the corresponding tiling models, some of which are new.

It combines features in\nan additive manner, allowing each to have either a linear or nonlinear effect\non the response. However, the choice of which features to treat as linear or\nnonlinear is typically assumed known. Thus, to make a GPLAM a viable approach\nin situations in which little is known $a~priori$ about the features, one must\novercome two primary model selection challenges: deciding which features to\ninclude in the model and determining which of these features to treat\nnonlinearly. We introduce the sparse partially linear additive model (SPLAM),\nwhich combines model fitting and $both$ of these model selection challenges\ninto a single convex optimization problem. SPLAM provides a bridge between the\nlasso and sparse additive models. Through a statistical oracle inequality and\nthorough simulation, we demonstrate that SPLAM can outperform other methods\nacross a broad spectrum of statistical regimes, including the high-dimensional\n($p\\gg N$) setting. We develop efficient algorithms that are applied to real\ndata sets with half a million samples and over 45,000 features with excellent\npredictive performance.

A new point of view\nis offered for the solution of constrained optimization problems. Some\nclassical optimization techniques on Euclidean space are generalized to\nRiemannian manifolds. Several algorithms are presented and their convergence\nproperties are analyzed employing the Riemannian structure of the manifold.\nSpecifically, two apparently new algorithms, which can be thought of as\nNewton's method and the conjugate gradient method on Riemannian manifolds, are\npresented and shown to possess, respectively, quadratic and superlinear\nconvergence. Examples of each method on certain Riemannian manifolds are given\nwith the results of numerical experiments. Rayleigh's quotient defined on the\nsphere is one example. It is shown that Newton's method applied to this\nfunction converges cubically, and that the Rayleigh quotient iteration is an\nefficient approximation of Newton's method. The Riemannian version of the\nconjugate gradient method applied to this function gives a new algorithm for\nfinding the eigenvectors corresponding to the extreme eigenvalues of a\nsymmetric matrix. Another example arises from extremizing the function\n$\\mathop{\\rm tr} {\\Theta}^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\rm T}Q{\\Theta}N$ on the special\northogonal group. In a similar example, it is shown that Newton's method\napplied to the sum of the squares of the off-diagonal entries of a symmetric\nmatrix converges cubically.

The perfect matching\nproblem is to decide if $G$ has such a matching. Recently Rothvo{\\ss} proved\nthe striking result that the Edmonds' matching polytope has exponential\nextension complexity. Here for each $n=|V|$ we describe a perfect matching\npolytope that is different from Edmonds' polytope and define a weaker notion of\nextended formulation. We show that the new polytope has a weak extended\nformulation (WEF) $Q$ of polynomial size. For each graph $G$ with $n$ vertices\nwe can readily construct an objective function so that solving the resulting\nlinear program over $Q$ decides whether or not $G$ has a perfect matching. The\nconstruction is uniform in the sense that, for each $n$, a single polytope is\ndefined for the class of all graphs with $n$ nodes. The method extends to solve\npoly time optimization problems, such as the weighted matching problem. In this\ncase a logarithmic (in the weight of the optimum solution) number of\noptimizations are made over the constructed WEF.\n  The method described in the paper involves construction of a compiler that\nconverts an algorithm given in a prescribed pseudocode into a polytope. It can\ntherefore be used to construct a polytope for any decision problem in {\\bf P}\nwhich can be solved by a given algorithm. Compared with earlier results of\nDobkin-Lipton-Reiss and Valiant our method allows the construction of explicit\nlinear programs directly from algorithms written for a standard register model,\nwithout intermediate transformations. We apply our results to obtain polynomial\nupper bounds on the non-negative rank of certain slack matrices related to\nmembership testing of languages in {\\bf P/Poly}.

It consists of\na group of k-centroids clusterings. Each clustering randomly selects data\npoints with randomly selected features as its centroids, and learns a one-hot\nencoder by one-nearest-neighbor optimization. Geometrically, the nonparametric\ndensity estimator at each layer projects the input data space to a\nuniformly-distributed discrete feature space, where the similarity of two data\npoints in the discrete feature space is measured by the number of the nearest\ncentroids they share in common. The multilayer network gradually reduces the\nnonlinear variations of data from bottom up by building a vast number of\nhierarchical trees implicitly on the original data space. Theoretically, the\nestimation error caused by the nonparametric density estimator is proportional\nto the correlation between the clusterings, both of which are reduced by the\nrandomization steps.

In particular, Boolean quadratic polytopes appear\nas faces of polytopes in every of the mentioned families.

We present a blue\nnoise sampling method with good quality and performance across different\ndimensions. The method, spoke-dart sampling, shoots rays from prior samples and\nselects samples from these rays. It combines the advantages of two major\nhigh-dimensional sampling methods: the locality of advancing front with the\ndimensionality-reduction of hyperplanes, specifically line sampling. We prove\nthat the output sampling is saturated with high probability, with bounds on\ndistances between pairs of samples and between any domain point and its nearest\nsample. We demonstrate spoke-dart applications for approximate Delaunay graph\nconstruction, global optimization, and robotic motion planning.

Our form of the exponent is\nan exact analogue of Arimoto's, given as a transform of the Renyi capacities\nwith parameters alpha>1. It is important to note that, unlike in the classical\ncase, there are many inequivalent ways to define the Renyi divergence of\nstates, and hence the R\\'enyi capacities of channels. Our exponent is in terms\nof the Renyi capacities corresponding to a version of the Renyi divergences\nthat has been introduced recently in [M\\\"uller-Lennert, Dupuis, Szehr, Fehr and\nTomamichel, J. Math. Phys. 54, 122203, (2013)], and [Wilde, Winter, Yang,\nCommun. Math. Phys. 331, (2014)]. Our result adds to the growing body of\nevidence that this new version is the natural definition for the purposes of\nstrong converse problems.

While the original algorithm uses groups of odd size at least\n$5$ and runs in linear time, it has been perpetuated in the literature that\nusing smaller group sizes will force the worst-case running time to become\nsuperlinear, namely $\\Omega(n \\log{n})$. We first point out that the arguments\nexistent in the literature justifying the superlinear worst-case running time\nfall short of proving this claim. We further prove that it is possible to use\ngroup size smaller than $5$ while maintaining the worst case linear running\ntime. To this end we introduce three simple variants of the classical\nalgorithm, the repeated step algorithm, the shifting target algorithm, and the\nhyperpair algorithm, all running in linear time.

Based\non the data it receives from multiple antennas, the fusion center formulates a\nmatrix, which, in conjunction with standard array processing schemes, such as\nMUSIC, leads to target detection and parameter estimation. In MIMO radars with\ncompressive sensing (MIMO-CS), the data matrix is formulated by each receive\nnode forwarding a small number of compressively obtained samples. In this\npaper, it is shown that under certain conditions, in both sampling cases, the\ndata matrix at the fusion center is low-rank, and thus can be recovered based\non knowledge of a small subset of its entries via matrix completion (MC)\ntechniques. Leveraging the low-rank property of that matrix, we propose a new\nMIMO radar approach, termed, MIMO-MC radar, in which each receive node either\nperforms matched filtering with a small number of randomly selected dictionary\nwaveforms or obtains sub-Nyquist samples of the received signal at random\nsampling instants, and forwards the results to a fusion center. Based on the\nreceived samples, and with knowledge of the sampling scheme, the fusion center\npartially fills the data matrix and subsequently applies MC techniques to\nestimate the full matrix. MIMO-MC radars share the advantages of the recently\nproposed MIMO-CS radars, i.e., high resolution with reduced amounts of data,\nbut unlike MIMO-CS radars do not require grid discretization. The MIMO-MC radar\nconcept is illustrated through a linear uniform array configuration, and its\ntarget estimation performance is demonstrated via simulations.

They perform different analyses over\nthe structure and content of webpages to extract some part of the document.\nHowever, their objective is different. While template detection identifies the\ntemplate of a webpage (usually comparing with other webpages of the same\nwebsite), content extraction identifies the main content of the webpage\ndiscarding the other part. Therefore, they are somehow complementary, because\nthe main content is not part of the template. It has been measured that\ntemplates represent between 40% and 50% of data on the Web. Therefore,\nidentifying templates is essential for indexing tasks because templates usually\ncontain irrelevant information such as advertisements, menus and banners.\nProcessing and storing this information is likely to lead to a waste of\nresources (storage space, bandwidth, etc.). Similarly, identifying the main\ncontent is essential for many information retrieval tasks. In this paper, we\npresent a benchmark suite to test different approaches for template detection\nand content extraction. The suite is public, and it contains real heterogeneous\nwebpages that have been labelled so that different techniques can be suitable\n(and automatically) compared.

It is proved that the restriction of quantum\ncomputation to the DQC1 model does not change the complexity classes NQP and\nSBQP. As a main consequence, it follows that the DQC1 model cannot be\nefficiently simulated by classical computers unless the polynomial-time\nhierarchy collapses to the second level (more precisely, to AM), which answers\nthe long-standing open problem posed by Knill and Laflamme under the very\nplausible complexity assumption.

However, few behavioral data indicating social influence dynamics\nhave been obtained from direct observation in `natural' social contexts. The\npresent research provides that kind of evidence in the case of the public\nexpression of political preferences in the city of Barcelona, where thousands\nof citizens supporting the secession of Catalonia from Spain have placed a\nCatalan flag in their balconies. We present two different studies. 1) In July\n2013 we registered the number of flags in 26% of the the city. We find that\nthere is a large dispersion in the density of flags in districts with similar\ndensity of pro-independence voters. However, we find that the density of flags\ntends to be fostered in those electoral district where there is a clear\nmajority of pro-independence vote, while it is inhibited in the opposite cases.\n2) During 17 days around Catalonia's 2013 National Holiday we observed the\nposition at balcony resolution of the flags displayed in the facades of 82\nblocks. We compare the clustering of flags on the facades observed each day to\nequivalent random distributions and find that successive hangings of flags are\nnot independent events but that a local influence mechanism is favoring their\nclustering. We also find that except for the National Holiday day the density\nof flags tends to be fostered in those facades where there is a clear majority\nof pro-independence vote.

Previously, two transmission frameworks have been proposed for the DoF\nanalysis when $N \\geq 2M$, where $M$ and $N$ denote the number of antennas at\neach source node and the relay node respectively. The first method is named as\nsignal group based alignment proposed by Hua et al. in [1]. The second is named\nas signal pattern approach introduced by Wang et al. in [2]. But both of them\nonly studied certain antenna configurations. The maximum achievable DoF in the\ngeneral case still remains unknown. In this work, we first derive a new upper\nbound of the DoF using the genie-aided approach. Then, we propose a more\ngeneral transmission framework, generalized signal alignment (GSA), and show\nthat the previous two methods are both special cases of GSA. With GSA, we prove\nthat the new DoF upper bound is achievable when $\\frac{N}{M} \\in\n\\left(0,2+\\frac{4}{K(K-1)}\\right] \\cup \\left[K-2, +\\infty\\right)$. The DoF\nanalysis in this paper provides a major step forward towards the fundamental\ncapacity limit of the $K$-user MIMO Y channel. It also offers a new approach of\nintegrating interference alignment with physical layer network coding.

We also introduce a\nmethod for estimating the true noise level in our images, since even the low\nnoise images contain small amounts of noise. We evaluate the accuracy of our\nnoise estimation method on real and artificial noise, and investigate the\nPoisson-Gaussian noise model. Finally, we use our dataset to evaluate six\ndenoising algorithms: Active Random Field, BM3D, Bilevel-MRF, Multi-Layer\nPerceptron, and two versions of NL-means. We show that while the Multi-Layer\nPerceptron, Bilevel-MRF, and NL-means with soft threshold outperform BM3D on\ngray images with synthetic noise, they lag behind on our dataset.

Complex network\ntheory has been proposed as an attractive mathematical representation of\nfunctional brain networks. However, most of the current studies of functional\nbrain networks have focused on the computation of graph theoretic indices for\nstatic networks, i.e. long-time averages of connectivity networks. It is\nwell-known that functional connectivity is a dynamic process and the\nconstruction and reorganization of the networks is key to understanding human\ncognition. Therefore, there is a growing need to track dynamic functional brain\nnetworks and identify time intervals over which the network is\nquasi-stationary. In this paper, we present a tensor decomposition based method\nto identify temporally invariant 'network states' and find a common topographic\nrepresentation for each state. The proposed methods are applied to\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) data during the study of error-related negativity\n(ERN).

Such difficult categories demand more dedicated\nclassifiers. However, existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are\ntrained as flat N-way classifiers, and few efforts have been made to leverage\nthe hierarchical structure of categories. In this paper, we introduce\nhierarchical deep CNNs (HD-CNNs) by embedding deep CNNs into a category\nhierarchy. An HD-CNN separates easy classes using a coarse category classifier\nwhile distinguishing difficult classes using fine category classifiers. During\nHD-CNN training, component-wise pretraining is followed by global finetuning\nwith a multinomial logistic loss regularized by a coarse category consistency\nterm. In addition, conditional executions of fine category classifiers and\nlayer parameter compression make HD-CNNs scalable for large-scale visual\nrecognition. We achieve state-of-the-art results on both CIFAR100 and\nlarge-scale ImageNet 1000-class benchmark datasets. In our experiments, we\nbuild up three different HD-CNNs and they lower the top-1 error of the standard\nCNNs by 2.65%, 3.1% and 1.1%, respectively.

In this\ncontext, the graph structure of a system constrains the propagation of\ninformation through it.\n  Suppose a set of channels is a cut set between an information source and a\npotential sink. We prove that, if there is no disclosure from the source to the\ncut set, then there can be no disclosure to the sink. We introduce a new\nformalization of partial disclosure, called *blur operators*, and show that the\nsame cut property is preserved for disclosure to within a blur operator. This\ncut-blur property also implies a compositional principle, which ensures limited\ndisclosure for a class of systems that differ only beyond the cut.

This paper\naims to study the dynamics of discrete-time chaotic maps in the digital (i.e.,\nfinite-precision) domain. Differing from the traditional approaches treating a\ndigital chaotic map as a black box with different explanations according to the\ntest results of the output, the dynamical properties of such chaotic maps are\nfirst explored with a fixed-point arithmetic, using the Logistic map and the\nTent map as two representative examples, from a new perspective with the\ncorresponding state-mapping networks (SMNs). In an SMN, every possible value in\nthe digital domain is considered as a node and the mapping relationship between\nany pair of nodes is a directed edge. The scale-free properties of the Logistic\nmap's SMN are proved. The analytic results are further extended to the scenario\nof floating-point arithmetic and for other chaotic maps. Understanding the\nnetwork structure of a chaotic map's SMN in digital computers can facilitate\ncounteracting the undesirable degeneration of chaotic dynamics in\nfinite-precision domains, helping also classify and improve the randomness of\npseudo-random number sequences generated by iterating chaotic maps.

Our construction follows\nthe multilevel approach of Forney \\textit{et al.}, where we construct a\ncapacity-achieving polar code on each level. The component polar codes are\nshown to be naturally nested, thereby fulfilling the requirement of the\nmultilevel lattice construction. We prove that polar lattices are\n\\emph{AWGN-good}. Furthermore, using the technique of source polarization, we\npropose discrete Gaussian shaping over the polar lattice to satisfy the power\nconstraint. Both the construction and shaping are explicit, and the overall\ncomplexity of encoding and decoding is $O(N\\log N)$ for any fixed target error\nprobability.

Communications", "1411.0440": "Modelling serendipity in a computational context,We understand the term serendipity to describe a creative process that\ndevelops, in context, with the active participation of a creative agent, but\nnot entirely within that agent's control. While a system cannot be made to\nperform serendipitously on demand, nevertheless, we argue that its\n\\emph{serendipity potential} can be increased by means of a suitable system\narchitecture and other design choices. We distil a unified description of\nserendipitous occurrences from historical theorisations of serendipity and\ncreativity. This takes the form of a framework with six phases:\n\\emph{perception}, \\emph{attention}, \\emph{interest}, \\emph{explanation},\n\\emph{bridge}, and \\emph{valuation}. We then use this framework to organise a\nsurvey of literature in cognitive science, philosophy, and computing, which\nyields practical definitions of the six phases, along with heuristics for\nimplementation. We use the resulting model to evaluate the serendipity\npotential of four existing systems developed by others, and two systems\npreviously developed by two of us. Whereas most existing research that\nconsiders serendipity in a computing context deals with serendipity as a\nservice, we relate theories of serendipity to artificial intelligence practice\nand the development of autonomous systems. We outline representative directions\nfor future applications of our model in the domains of automated programming,\nrecommender systems, and computational creativity. We conclude that it is\nfeasible to equip computational systems with the potential for serendipity, and\nthat this could be beneficial in varied artificial intelligence applications,\nparticularly those designed to operate responsively in real-world contexts.

In 1993, Luby and Nisan constructed an iterative algorithm for\napproximately solving PC-LPs in nearly linear time, where the time complexity\nscales nearly linearly in $N$, the number of nonzero entries of the matrix, and\npolynomially in $\\varepsilon$, the (multiplicative) approximation error.\nUnfortunately, all existing nearly linear-time algorithms for solving PC-LPs\nrequire time at least proportional to $\\varepsilon^{-2}$.\n  In this paper, we break this longstanding barrier by designing a packing\nsolver that runs in time $\\tilde{O}(N \\varepsilon^{-1})$ and covering LP solver\nthat runs in time $\\tilde{O}(N \\varepsilon^{-1.5})$. Our packing solver can be\nextended to run in time $\\tilde{O}(N \\varepsilon^{-1})$ for a class of\nwell-behaved covering programs. In a follow-up work, Wang et al. showed that\nall covering LPs can be converted into well-behaved ones by a reduction that\nblows up the problem size only logarithmically.\n  At high level, these two algorithms can be described as linear couplings of\nseveral first-order descent steps. This is an application of our linear\ncoupling technique to problems that are not amenable to blackbox applications\nknown iterative algorithms in convex optimization.

Motivated\nby a shared structure found in inferential problems of recent interest---namely\northogonal tensor decompositions, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), topic\nmodels, spectral clustering, and Gaussian mixture learning---we generalize the\neigendecomposition from quadratic forms to a broad class of \"orthogonally\ndecomposable\" functions. We identify a key role of convexity in our extension,\nand we generalize two traditional characterizations of eigenvectors: First, the\neigenvectors of a quadratic form arise from the optima structure of the\nquadratic form on the sphere. Second, the eigenvectors are the fixed points of\nthe power iteration.\n  In our setting, we consider a simple first order generalization of the power\nmethod which we call gradient iteration. It leads to efficient and easily\nimplementable methods for basis recovery. It includes influential Machine\nLearning methods such as cumulant-based FastICA and the tensor power iteration\nfor orthogonally decomposable tensors as special cases.\n  We provide a complete theoretical analysis of gradient iteration using the\nstructure theory of discrete dynamical systems to show almost sure convergence\nand fast (super-linear) convergence rates. The analysis also extends to the\ncase when the observed function is only approximately orthogonally\ndecomposable, with bounds that are polynomial in dimension and other relevant\nparameters, such as perturbation size. Our perturbation results can be\nconsidered as a non-linear version of the classical Davis-Kahan theorem for\nperturbations of eigenvectors of symmetric matrices.

We are\ninterested in bounding what we call the biased price of anarchy (BPoA) in\npopulations with diverse agent behaviors, which is the ratio between welfare in\nthe \"wrong\" equilibrium and optimal welfare.\n  We study nonatomic routing games, and derive an externality bound that\ndepends on a key topological parameter of the underlying network.\n  We then prove two general BPoA bounds for games with diverse populations: one\nthat relies on the network structure and the average bias of all agents in the\npopulation, and one that is independent of the structure but depends on the\nmaximal bias. Both types of bounds can be combined with known results to derive\nconcrete BPoA bounds for a variety of specific behaviors (e.g., varied levels\nof risk-aversion).

Similar results have been also given in [Schnorr Stumpf 75]\n(see also [Lynch 75]). Earlier relevant work (classical theorems like\nCompression, Speed-up, etc.) was done in [Tseitin 56, Rabin 59, Hartmanis\nStearns 65, Blum 67, Trakhtenbrot 67, Meyer Fischer 72].\n  I translated only the part with the statement of the results. Instead of the\nproof part I appended a later (1979, unpublished) proof sketch of a slightly\ntighter version. The improvement is based on the results of [Meyer Winklmann\n78, Sipser 78]. Meyer and Winklmann extended earlier versions to machines with\na separate input and working tape, thus allowing complexities smaller than the\ninput length (down to its log). Sipser showed the space-bounded Halting Problem\nto require only additive constant overhead. The proof in the appendix below\nemploys both advances to extend the original proofs to machines with a fixed\nalphabet and a separate input and working space. The extension has no (even\nlogarithmic) restrictions on complexity and no overhead (beyond an additive\nconstant). The sketch is very brief and a more detailed exposition is expected\nlater: [Seiferas Meyer].

In the present work, we investigate whether deviations from\nthese universal patterns may reveal information about the socio-economical\nstatus of geographical regions. We quantify the extent to which deviations in\ndiurnal rhythm, mobility patterns, and communication styles across regions\nrelate to their unemployment incidence. For this we examine a country-scale\npublicly articulated social media dataset, where we quantify individual\nbehavioral features from over 145 million geo-located messages distributed\namong more than 340 different Spanish economic regions, inferred by computing\ncommunities of cohesive mobility fluxes. We find that regions exhibiting more\ndiverse mobility fluxes, earlier diurnal rhythms, and more correct grammatical\nstyles display lower unemployment rates. As a result, we provide a simple model\nable to produce accurate, easily interpretable reconstruction of regional\nunemployment incidence from their social-media digital fingerprints alone. Our\nresults show that cost-effective economical indicators can be built based on\npublicly-available social media datasets.

Counterintuitively enough, such a\nmediation-driven attachment rule results not only in preferential but\nsuper-preferential attachment, albeit in disguise. We show that for small $m$,\nthe dynamics of our model is governed by winners take all phenomenon, and for\nhigher $m$ it is governed by winners take some. Besides, we show that the mean\nof the inverse harmonic mean of degrees of the neighborhood of all existing\nnodes is a measure that can well qualify how straight the degree distribution\nis.

We use both DFA and MFDFA\nto analyze the time series in online viewing activity separating from Movielens\nand Netflix. We find long-term correlations at both the individual and communal\nlevel, and that the extent of correlation at the individual level is determined\nby the activity level. These long-term correlations also indicate that there is\nfractality in the pattern of online viewing. And, we firstly find a\nmultifractality that results from the combined effect of the fat-tailed\ndistribution of inter-event times (i.e., the times between successive viewing\nactions of individual) and the long-term correlations in online viewing\nactivity and verify this finding using three synthesized series. Therefore, it\ncan be concluded that the multifractality in online viewing activity is caused\nby both the fat-tailed distribution of inter-event times and the long-term\ncorrelations, and that this enlarges the generic property of human activity to\ninclude not just physical space, but also cyberspace.

This is the first o(mn) time deterministic\nalgorithm for the problem. In near-linear time we can also construct the\nclassic cactus representation of all minimum cuts.\n  The previous fastest deterministic algorithm by Gabow from STOC'91 took\n~O(m+k^2 n), where k is the edge connectivity, but k could be Omega(n).\n  At STOC'96 Karger presented a randomized near linear time Monte Carlo\nalgorithm for the minimum cut problem. As he points out, there is no better way\nof certifying the minimality of the returned cut than to use Gabow's slower\ndeterministic algorithm and compare sizes.\n  Our main technical contribution is a near-linear time algorithm that contract\nvertex sets of a simple input graph G with minimum degree d, producing a\nmultigraph with ~O(m/d) edges which preserves all minimum cuts of G with at\nleast 2 vertices on each side.\n  In our deterministic near-linear time algorithm, we will decompose the\nproblem via low-conductance cuts found using PageRank a la Brin and Page\n(1998), as analyzed by Andersson, Chung, and Lang at FOCS'06. Normally such\nalgorithms for low-conductance cuts are randomized Monte Carlo algorithms,\nbecause they rely on guessing a good start vertex.

The goal of this paper is to present an observation about\nthe graph of the subtyping relation in Java, namely the observation that, after\nthe addition of generics---and of wildcards, in particular---to Java, the graph\nof the subtyping relation is no longer a simple directed-acyclic graph (DAG),\nas in pre-generics Java, but is rather a fractal. Further, this observation\nequally applies to other mainstream nominally-typed OO languages (such as C#,\nC++ and Scala) where generics and wildcards (or some other form of 'variance\nannotations') are standard features. Accordingly, the shape of the subtyping\nrelation in these OO languages is more complex than a tree or a simple DAG, and\nindeed is also a fractal. Given the popularity of fractals, the fractal\nobservation may help OO software developers keep a useful and intuitive mental\nimage of their software's subtyping relation, even if it is a little more\nfrightening, and more amazing one than before. With proper support from IDEs,\nthe fractal observation can help OO developers in resolving type errors they\nmay find in their code in lesser time, and with more confidence.

The TL1 penalty interpolates $l_0$ and $l_1$ norms through a\nnonnegative parameter $a \\in (0,+\\infty)$, similar to $l_p$ with $p \\in (0,1]$,\nand is known to satisfy unbiasedness, sparsity and Lipschitz continuity\nproperties. We first consider the constrained minimization problem and discuss\nthe exact recovery of $l_0$ norm minimal solution based on the null space\nproperty (NSP). We then prove the stable recovery of $l_0$ norm minimal\nsolution if the sensing matrix $A$ satisfies a restricted isometry property\n(RIP). Next, we present difference of convex algorithms for TL1 (DCATL1) in\ncomputing TL1-regularized constrained and unconstrained problems in CS. The\ninner loop concerns an $l_1$ minimization problem on which we employ the\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). For the unconstrained\nproblem, we prove convergence of DCATL1 to a stationary point satisfying the\nfirst order optimality condition. In numerical experiments, we identify the\noptimal value $a=1$, and compare DCATL1 with other CS algorithms on two classes\nof sensing matrices: Gaussian random matrices and over-sampled discrete cosine\ntransform matrices (DCT). We find that for both classes of sensing matrices,\nthe performance of DCATL1 algorithm (initiated with $l_1$ minimization) always\nranks near the top (if not the top), and is the most robust choice insensitive\nto the conditioning of the sensing matrix $A$. DCATL1 is also competitive in\ncomparison with DCA on other non-convex penalty functions commonly used in\nstatistics with two hyperparameters.

In this\nmanuscript, we studied the interplay between positive and negative ties on\nmesoscopic level of these networks, i.e., their community structure. A\ncommunity is considered as a tightly interconnected group of actors; therefore,\nit does not borrow any assumption from balance theory and merely uses the\nwell-known assumption in the community detection literature. We found that if\none detects the communities based on only positive relations (by ignoring the\nnegative ones), the majority of negative relations are already placed between\nthe communities. In other words, negative ties do not have a major role in\ndetecting communities of studied signed networks. Moreover, regarding the\ninternal negative ties, we proved that most unbalanced communities are\nmaximally balanced, and hence they cannot be partitioned into k nonempty\nsub-clusters with higher balancedness (k >= 2). Furthermore, we showed that\nalthough the mediator triad ++- (hostile-mediator-hostile) is underrepresented,\nit constitutes a considerable portion of triadic relations among communities.\nHence, mediator triads should not be ignored by community detection and\nclustering algorithms. As a result, if one uses a clustering algorithm that\noperates merely based on social balance, mesoscopic structure of signed\nnetworks significantly remains hidden.

In particular, Canonne, Ron, and Servedio\n(SICOMP 2015) showed that, in this setting, testing identity of an unknown\ndistribution $D$ (whether $D=D^\\ast$ for an explicitly known $D^\\ast$) can be\ndone with a constant number of queries, independent of the support size $n$ --\nin contrast to the required $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ in the standard sampling model.\nIt was unclear whether the same stark contrast exists for the case of testing\nequivalence, where both distributions are unknown. While Canonne et al.\nestablished a $\\mathrm{poly}(\\log n)$-query upper bound for equivalence\ntesting, very recently brought down to $\\tilde O(\\log\\log n)$ by Falahatgar et\nal. (COLT 2015), whether a dependence on the domain size $n$ is necessary was\nstill open, and explicitly posed by Fischer at the Bertinoro Workshop on\nSublinear Algorithms (2014). We show that any testing algorithm for equivalence\nmust make $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log\\log n})$ queries in the conditional sampling\nmodel. This demonstrates a gap between identity and equivalence testing, absent\nin the standard sampling model (where both problems have sampling complexity\n$n^{\\Theta(1)}$).\n  We also obtain results on the query complexity of uniformity testing and\nsupport-size estimation with conditional samples. We answer a question of\nChakraborty et al. (ITCS 2013) showing that non-adaptive uniformity testing\nindeed requires $\\Omega(\\log n)$ queries in the conditional model. For the\nrelated problem of support-size estimation, we provide both adaptive and\nnon-adaptive algorithms, with query complexities $\\mathrm{poly}(\\log\\log n)$\nand $\\mathrm{poly}(\\log n)$, respectively.

The growing accessibility to ICT\ninformation from portable digital media has recently opened the possibility of\nexploring human behavior at high spatio-temporal resolutions. Mobile phone\nrecords, geolocated tweets, check-ins from Foursquare or geotagged photos, have\ncontributed to this purpose at different scales, from cities to countries, in\ndifferent world areas. Many previous works lacked, however, details on the\nindividuals' attributes such as age or gender. In this work, we analyze\ncredit-card records from Barcelona and Madrid and by examining the geolocated\ncredit-card transactions of individuals living in the two provinces, we find\nthat the mobility patterns vary according to gender, age and occupation.\nDifferences in distance traveled and travel purpose are observed between\nyounger and older people, but, curiously, either between males and females of\nsimilar age. While mobility displays some generic features, here we show that\nsociodemographic characteristics play a relevant role and must be taken into\naccount for mobility and epidemiological modelization.

Furthermore, we describe an algorithm to decide general\ntightness in the case of $4$-dimensional combinatorial manifolds which is fixed\nparameter tractable in the treewidth of the $1$-skeletons of their vertex\nlinks, and we present an algorithm to decide $\\mathbb{F}_2$-tightness for weak\npseudomanifolds $M$ of arbitrary but fixed dimension which is fixed parameter\ntractable in the treewidth of the dual graph of $M$.

This chapter presents a\ntutorial description of four important aspects of sensing-based information\ndiffusion in social networks from a communications/signal processing\nperspective. First, diffusion models for information exchange in large scale\nsocial networks together with social sensing via social media networks such as\nTwitter is considered. Second, Bayesian social learning models and risk averse\nsocial learning is considered with applications in finance and online\nreputation systems. Third, the principle of revealed preferences arising in\nmicro-economics theory is used to parse datasets to determine if social sensors\nare utility maximizers and then determine their utility functions. Finally, the\ninteraction of social sensors with YouTube channel owners is studied using time\nseries analysis methods. All four topics are explained in the context of actual\nexperimental datasets from health networks, social media and psychological\nexperiments. Also, algorithms are given that exploit the above models to infer\nunderlying events based on social sensing. The overview, insights, models and\nalgorithms presented in this chapter stem from recent developments in network\nscience, economics and signal processing. At a deeper level, this chapter\nconsiders mean field dynamics of networks, risk averse Bayesian social learning\nfiltering and quickest change detection, data incest in decision making over a\ndirected acyclic graph of social sensors, inverse optimization problems for\nutility function estimation (revealed preferences) and statistical modeling of\ninteracting social sensors in YouTube social networks.

We first establish a bound on the\neavesdropper's advantage in guessing functions of the message in terms of\nmaximal correlation and the R\\'enyi entropy of the message. This result implies\nthat maximal correlation is stronger than the notion of entropic security\nintroduced by Russell and Wang. We then show that a small maximal correlation\n$\\rho$ can be achieved via a randomly generated cipher with key length\n$\\approx2\\log(1/\\rho)$, independent of the message length, and by a stream\ncipher with key length $2\\log(1/\\rho)+\\log n+2$ for a message of length $n$. We\nestablish a converse showing that these ciphers are close to optimal. This is\nin contrast to entropic security for which there is a gap between the lower and\nupper bounds. Finally, we show that a small maximal correlation implies secrecy\nwith respect to several mutual information based criteria but is not\nnecessarily implied by them. Hence, maximal correlation is a stronger and more\npractically relevant measure of secrecy than mutual information.

This has several nice\napplications; among them, we shall discuss an efficient encoding/decoding/error\ncorrection strategy for line polar Grassmann codes of both types.

The timestamp is eventually periodic and is constructed\nvia a finite periodic augmented region automaton. A consequence of this\nconstruction is the periodicity of the language of timed automata with respect\nto suffixes. Applications include the decidability of the 1-bounded language\ninclusion problem for the class eNTA, and a partial method, not bounded by time\nor number of steps, for the general language non-inclusion problem for eNTA.

In\nthis paper, we present the Heat Conduction (HC) model which is a\nnon-progressive influence model with real-world interpretations. We show that\nHC unifies, generalizes, and extends the existing nonprogressive models, such\nas the Voter model [1] and non-progressive LT [2]. We then prove that selecting\nthe optimal seed set of influential nodes is NP-hard for HC but by establishing\nthe submodularity of influence spread, we can tackle the influence maximization\nproblem with a scalable and provably near-optimal greedy algorithm. We are the\nfirst to present a scalable solution for influence maximization under\nnonprogressive LT model, as a special case of the HC model. In sharp contrast\nto the other greedy influence maximization methods, our fast and efficient\nC2GREEDY algorithm benefits from two analytically computable steps: closed-form\ncomputation for finding the influence spread as well as the greedy seed\nselection. Through extensive experiments on several large real and synthetic\nnetworks, we show that C2GREEDY outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, in\nterms of both influence spread and scalability.

Can we infer E from them? Prima facie\nthis seems impossible, since the agents may be lying. We model this task by\nletting the events be distributed according to some distribution p and the task\nis to estimate p under unknown noise. Again, this is impossible without\nadditional assumptions. We report here the finding of very natural such\nassumptions - the availability of multiple copies of the true data, each under\nindependent and invertible (in the sense of matrices) noise, is already\nsufficient: If the true distribution and the observations are modeled on the\nsame finite alphabet, then the number of such copies needed to determine p to\nthe highest possible precision is exactly three! This result can be seen as a\ncounterpart to independent component analysis. Therefore, we call our approach\n'dependent component analysis'. In addition, we present generalizations of the\nmodel to different alphabet sizes at in- and output. A second result is found:\nthe 'activation' of invertibility through multiple parallel uses.

In\nparticular, the rule of ND works to select the nearest node in the descending\ndirection of potential as the parent node of each node, which is in essence\ndifferent from the classical Gradient Descent or Steepest Descent. The\nconstructed In-Tree proves a very good candidate for clustering due to its\nparticular features and properties. In the In-Tree, the original clustering\nproblem is reduced to a problem of removing a very few of undesired edges from\nthis graph. Pleasingly, the undesired edges in In-Tree are so distinguishable\nthat they can be easily determined in either automatic or interactive way,\nwhich is in stark contrast to the cases in the widely used Minimal Spanning\nTree and k-nearest-neighbor graph. The cluster number in the proposed method\ncan be easily determined based on some intermediate plots, and the cluster\nassignment for each node is easily made by quickly searching its root node in\neach sub-graph (also an In-Tree). The proposed method is extensively evaluated\non both synthetic and real-world datasets. Overall, the proposed clustering\nmethod is a density-based one, but shows significant differences and advantages\nin comparison to the traditional ones.

This paper revisits the problem\nof data-driven learning of these geometric structures and puts forth two new\nnonlinear geometric models for data describing \"related\" objects/phenomena. The\nfirst one of these models straddles the two extremes of the subspace model and\nthe union-of-subspaces model, and is termed the metric-constrained\nunion-of-subspaces (MC-UoS) model. The second one of these models---suited for\ndata drawn from a mixture of nonlinear manifolds---generalizes the kernel\nsubspace model, and is termed the metric-constrained kernel union-of-subspaces\n(MC-KUoS) model. The main contributions of this paper in this regard include\nthe following. First, it motivates and formalizes the problems of MC-UoS and\nMC-KUoS learning. Second, it presents algorithms that efficiently learn an\nMC-UoS or an MC-KUoS underlying data of interest. Third, it extends these\nalgorithms to the case when parts of the data are missing. Last, but not least,\nit reports the outcomes of a series of numerical experiments involving both\nsynthetic and real data that demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\ngeometric models and learning algorithms over existing approaches in the\nliterature. These experiments also help clarify the connections between this\nwork and the literature on (subspace and kernel k-means) clustering.

However, it is also a time-consuming and challenging task that\nrequires advanced skills beyond the abilities of casual photographers. Using an\nautomated algorithm is an appealing alternative to manual work but such an\nalgorithm faces many hurdles. Many photographic styles rely on subtle\nadjustments that depend on the image content and even its semantics. Further,\nthese adjustments are often spatially varying. Because of these\ncharacteristics, existing automatic algorithms are still limited and cover only\na subset of these challenges. Recently, deep machine learning has shown unique\nabilities to address hard problems that resisted machine algorithms for long.\nThis motivated us to explore the use of deep learning in the context of photo\nediting. In this paper, we explain how to formulate the automatic photo\nadjustment problem in a way suitable for this approach. We also introduce an\nimage descriptor that accounts for the local semantics of an image. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that our deep learning formulation applied using these\ndescriptors successfully capture sophisticated photographic styles. In\nparticular and unlike previous techniques, it can model local adjustments that\ndepend on the image semantics. We show on several examples that this yields\nresults that are qualitatively and quantitatively better than previous work.

It is assumed that a number of geographically-distributed,\ninterconnected sites have massive local data and they are interested in\ncollaboratively learning a low-dimensional geometric structure underlying these\ndata. In contrast to previous works on subspace-based data representations,\nthis paper focuses on the geometric structure of a union of subspaces (UoS). In\nthis regard, it proposes a distributed algorithm---termed cloud K-SVD---for\ncollaborative learning of a UoS structure underlying distributed data of\ninterest. The goal of cloud K-SVD is to learn a common overcomplete dictionary\nat each individual site such that every sample in the distributed data can be\nrepresented through a small number of atoms of the learned dictionary. Cloud\nK-SVD accomplishes this goal without requiring exchange of individual samples\nbetween sites. This makes it suitable for applications where sharing of raw\ndata is discouraged due to either privacy concerns or large volumes of data.\nThis paper also provides an analysis of cloud K-SVD that gives insights into\nits properties as well as deviations of the dictionaries learned at individual\nsites from a centralized solution in terms of different measures of\nlocal/global data and topology of interconnections. Finally, the paper\nnumerically illustrates the efficacy of cloud K-SVD on real and synthetic\ndistributed data. Comment: Accepted for Publication in IEEE Trans.

The properties that we\nstudy include diagonal non-computability, hyperimmunity, complete consistent\nextensions of Peano arithmetic, 1-genericity, Martin-L\\\"of randomness, and\ncohesiveness. The theorems that we include in our case study are the low basis\ntheorem of Jockusch and Soare, the Kleene-Post theorem, and Friedberg's jump\ninversion theorem. It turns out that all the aforementioned properties and many\ntheorems in computability theory, including all theorems that claim the\nexistence of some Turing degree, have very little uniform computational\ncontent: they are located outside of the upper cone of binary choice (also\nknown as LLPO); we call problems with this property indiscriminative. Since\npractically all theorems from classical analysis whose computational content\nhas been classified are discriminative, our observation could yield an\nexplanation for why theorems and results in computability theory typically have\nvery few direct consequences in other disciplines such as analysis. A notable\nexception in our case study is the low basis theorem which is discriminative.\nThis is perhaps why it is considered to be one of the most applicable theorems\nin computability theory. In some cases a bridge between the indiscriminative\nworld and the discriminative world of classical mathematics can be established\nvia a suitable residual operation and we demonstrate this in the case of the\ncohesiveness problem and the problem of consistent complete extensions of Peano\narithmetic. Both turn out to be the quotient of two discriminative problems.

With this understood, the Google\nBooks corpus remains an important data set to be considered more lexicon-like\nthan text-like. Here, we show that a distinct problematic feature arises from\nthe inclusion of scientific texts, which have become an increasingly\nsubstantive portion of the corpus throughout the 1900s. The result is a surge\nof phrases typical to academic articles but less common in general, such as\nreferences to time in the form of citations. We highlight these dynamics by\nexamining and comparing major contributions to the statistical divergence of\nEnglish data sets between decades in the period 1800--2000. We find that only\nthe English Fiction data set from the second version of the corpus is not\nheavily affected by professional texts, in clear contrast to the first version\nof the fiction data set and both unfiltered English data sets. Our findings\nemphasize the need to fully characterize the dynamics of the Google Books\ncorpus before using these data sets to draw broad conclusions about cultural\nand linguistic evolution.

The outcomes of Augur's prediction markets are chosen by users that\nhold Augur's native Reputation token, who stake their tokens on the actual\nobserved outcome and, in return, receive settlement fees from the markets.\nAugur's incentive structure is designed to ensure that honest, accurate\nreporting of outcomes is always the most profitable option for Reputation token\nholders. Token holders can post progressively-larger Reputation bonds to\ndispute proposed market outcomes. If the size of these bonds reaches a certain\nthreshold, Reputation splits into multiple versions, one for each possible\noutcome of the disputed market; token holders must then exchange their\nReputation tokens for one of these versions. Versions of Reputation which do\nnot correspond to the real-world outcome will become worthless, as no one will\nparticipate in prediction markets unless they are confident that the markets\nwill resolve correctly. Therefore, token holders will select the only version\nof Reputation which they know will continue to have value: the version that\ncorresponds to reality.

The idea explored in the paper is that functionals correspond to\ngeneric mechanisms for management of connections in arrays consisting of first\norder functional units. Functionals are higher order abstractions that are\nuseful for the management of such large arrays. Computations on higher order\nobjects comprise dynamic configuration of connections between first order\nelementary functions in the arrays. Once the functionals are considered as the\ngeneric mechanisms, they have a grounding in hardware. A conceptual framework\nfor constructing such mechanisms is presented, and their hardware realization\nis discussed.

In this paper, we consider a fundamental model\nwhere a set of n tasks is to be processed on C identical machines and each task\nis specified by a value, a workload, a deadline and a parallelism bound. Within\nthe parallelism bound, the number of machines assigned to a task can vary over\ntime without affecting its workload. For this model, we obtain two core\nresults: a sufficient and necessary condition such that a set of tasks can be\nfinished by their deadlines on C machines, and an algorithm to produce such a\nschedule. These core results provide a conceptual tool and an optimal\nscheduling algorithm that enable proposing new algorithmic analysis and design\nand improving existing algorithms under various objectives.

We also describe a practical\nsolution to demonstrate how to efficiently implement a typical\nDivide-and-Conquer algorithm on the GPU. We highly utilize the parallel\nprimitives provided by the library Thrust such as the parallel segmented scan\nfor better efficiency and simplicity. To evaluate the performance of our\nimplementation, we carry out four groups of experimental tests using two groups\nof point sets in two modes on the GPU K20c. Experimental results indicate that:\nour implementation can achieve the speedups of up to 10.98x over the\nstate-of-art CPU-based convex hull implementation Qhull [16]. In addition, our\nimplementation can find the convex hull of 20M points in about 0.2 seconds.

We show that without prior knowledge of the\ncorrelation structure, each of our architectures (under different sets of\nassumptions) can acquire the ensemble at a sub-Nyquist rate. Prior to sampling,\nthe analog signals are diversified using simple, implementable components. The\ndiversification is achieved by injecting types of \"structured randomness\" into\nthe ensemble, the result of which is subsampled. For reconstruction, the\nensemble is modeled as a low-rank matrix that we have observed through an\n(undetermined) set of linear equations. Our main results show that this matrix\ncan be recovered using standard convex programming techniques when the total\nnumber of samples is on the order of the intrinsic degree of freedom of the\nensemble --- the more heavily correlated the ensemble, the fewer samples are\nneeded.\n  To motivate this study, we discuss how such ensembles arise in the context of\narray processing.

A computational implementation in MatlabTM is presented\nand made available at the URL\nhttp://www2.ee.ufpe.br/codec/divisao_silabica.html. Due to its\nstraightforwardness, the proposed method is very attractive for embedded\nsystems (e.g. i-phones). It can also be used as a screen to assist more\nsophisticated methods. Voice excerpts containing more than one syllable and\nidentified by the same envelope are named as super-syllables and they are\nsubsequently separated. The results indicate which samples corresponds to the\nbeginning and end of each detected syllable. Preliminary tests were performed\nto fifty words at an identification rate circa 70% (further improvements may be\nincorporated to treat particular phonemes). This algorithm is also useful in\nvoice command systems, as a tool in the teaching of Portuguese language or even\nfor patients with speech pathology.

When large-scale datasets are present,\ntypical approaches usually employed truncated kernel methods on the feature\nspace or DC approaches on the sample space. However, this did not guarantee\nseparability between classes, owing to overfitting. To overcome such problems,\nthis work proposes a novel DC approach on feature spaces consisting of three\nsteps. Firstly, we divide the feature space into several subspaces using the\ndecomposition method proposed in this paper. Subsequently, these feature\nsubspaces are sent into individual local classifiers for training. Finally, the\noutcomes of local classifiers are fused together to generate the final\nclassification results. Experiments on large-scale datasets are carried out for\nperformance evaluation. The results show that the error rates of the proposed\nDC method decreased comparing with the state-of-the-art fast SVM solvers, e.g.,\nreducing error rates by 10.53% and 7.53% on RCV1 and covtype datasets\nrespectively.

We show that if D is a distribution\nover subadditive valuations with independent items, then the better of pricing\neach item separately or pricing only the grand bundle achieves a\nconstant-factor approximation to the revenue of the optimal mechanism. This\nincludes buyers who are k-demand, additive up to a matroid constraint, or\nadditive up to constraints of any downwards-closed set system (and whose values\nfor the individual items are sampled independently), as well as buyers who are\nfractionally subadditive with item multipliers drawn independently. Our proof\nmakes use of the core-tail decomposition framework developed in prior work\nshowing similar results for the significantly simpler class of additive buyers\n[LY13, BILW14].\n  In the second part of the paper, we develop a connection between\napproximately optimal simple mechanisms and approximate revenue monotonicity\nwith respect to buyers' valuations. Revenue non-monotonicity is the phenomenon\nthat sometimes strictly increasing buyers' values for every set can strictly\ndecrease the revenue of the optimal mechanism [HR12]. Using our main result, we\nderive a bound on how bad this degradation can be (and dub such a bound a proof\nof approximate revenue monotonicity); we further show that better bounds on\napproximate monotonicity imply a better analysis of our simple mechanisms.

Referring to past research done and proving new theorems and also\nusing a suggested simple technique taking advantage of the easy concept of\nKarnaugh map, we offer an algorithm to reduce the number of occupied squares in\nthe map and therefore, reduce substantially the execution time for placing data\nbits in Karnaugh map. Based on earlier papers, we first propose an algorithm\nfor correction of two simultaneous errors in a code. Then, defining\nspecifications for empty squares of the map, we limit the choices for selection\nof new squares. In addition, burst errors in sending codes is discussed, and\nsystematically code words for correcting them will be made.

It is well known that it takes $O(m+n)$ time to\nbuild a DFS tree for a given undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ on $n$ vertices and $m$\nedges. We address the problem of maintaining a DFS tree when the graph is\nundergoing {\\em updates} (insertion and deletion of vertices or edges). We\npresent the following results for this problem.\n  (a) Fault tolerant DFS tree: There exists a data structure of size ${O}(m\n~polylog~ n)$ such that given any set ${\\cal F}$ of failed vertices or edges, a\nDFS tree of the graph $G\\setminus {\\cal F}$ can be reported in ${O}(n|{\\cal F}|\n~polylog~ n)$ time.\n  (b) Fully dynamic DFS tree: There exists a fully dynamic algorithm for\nmaintaining a DFS tree that takes worst case ${O}(\\sqrt{mn} ~polylog~ n)$ time\nper update for any arbitrary online sequence of updates.\n  (c) Incremental DFS tree: Given any arbitrary online sequence of edge\ninsertions, we can maintain a DFS tree in ${O}(n ~polylog~ n)$ worst case time\nper edge insertion.\n  These are the first $o(m)$ worst case time results for maintaining a DFS tree\nin a dynamic environment. Moreover, our fully dynamic algorithm provides, in a\nseamless manner, the first deterministic algorithm with $O(1)$ query time and\n$o(m)$ worst case update time for the dynamic subgraph connectivity,\nbiconnectivity, and 2-edge connectivity.

For the purpose of\nefficient simulations, we devise a parallel solution algorithm targeting\nmulti-socket shared memory architectures. The model integrates infectious\ndynamics as continuous-time Markov chains and available data such as animal\nmovements or aging are incorporated as externally defined events. To bring out\nparallelism and accelerate the computations, we decompose the spatial domain\nand optimize cross-boundary communication using dependency-aware task\nscheduling. Using registered livestock data at a high spatio-temporal\nresolution, we demonstrate that our approach not only is resilient to varying\nmodel configurations, but also scales on all physical cores at realistic work\nloads. Finally, we show that these very features enable the solution of inverse\nproblems on national scales.

In this paper, we shall develop this unified view of\ncontextuality. We provide two main contributions: firstly, we expose a\nremarkable connection between contexuality and logical paradoxes; secondly, we\nshow that an important class of contextuality arguments has a topological\norigin. More specifically, we show that \"All-vs-Nothing\" proofs of\ncontextuality are witnessed by cohomological obstructions.

We do this for the most part without\nproofs, and often without precise definitions, leaving these to the formal\ndevelopment of the theory that begins in Section 2. Our presentation of the\ntheory draws heavily on the work of Gehrke, Grigorieff and Pin (2008) on the\nequational theory of lattices of regular languages. In the subsequent sections\nwe consider in more detail aspects of varieties that were only briefly evoked\nin the introduction: Decidability, operations on languages, and\ncharacterizations in formal logic.

Each decision-maker\nwould individually prefer to \"exploit\": select an action with the highest\nexpected reward given her current information. At the same time, each\ndecision-maker would prefer previous decision-makers to \"explore\", producing\ninformation about the rewards of various actions. A social planner, by means of\ncarefully designed information disclosure, can incentivize the agents to\nbalance the exploration and exploitation so as to maximize social welfare.\n  We formulate this problem as a multi-armed bandit problem (and various\ngeneralizations thereof) under incentive-compatibility constraints induced by\nthe agents' Bayesian priors. We design an incentive-compatible bandit algorithm\nfor the social planner whose regret is asymptotically optimal among all bandit\nalgorithms (incentive-compatible or not). Further, we provide a black-box\nreduction from an arbitrary multi-arm bandit algorithm to an\nincentive-compatible one, with only a constant multiplicative increase in\nregret. This reduction works for very general bandit setting that incorporate\ncontexts and arbitrary auxiliary feedback.

Spectral methods are based on a first-order\nMarkov chain derived from a random walk on the graph and thus they cannot take\nadvantage of important higher-order network substructures such as triangles,\ncycles, and feed-forward loops. Here we propose a Tensor Spectral Clustering\n(TSC) algorithm that allows for modeling higher-order network structures in a\ngraph partitioning framework. Our TSC algorithm allows the user to specify\nwhich higher-order network structures (cycles, feed-forward loops, etc.) should\nbe preserved by the network clustering. Higher-order network structures of\ninterest are represented using a tensor, which we then partition by developing\na multilinear spectral method. Our framework can be applied to discovering\nlayered flows in networks as well as graph anomaly detection, which we\nillustrate on synthetic networks. In directed networks, a higher-order\nstructure of particular interest is the directed 3-cycle, which captures\nfeedback loops in networks. We demonstrate that our TSC algorithm produces\nlarge partitions that cut fewer directed 3-cycles than standard spectral\nclustering algorithms.

Most of this\nliterature is about methods based on supervised learning, i.e., methods for\ntraining an information extraction system from manually annotated examples.\nWhile a lot of work has been devoted to devising learning methods that generate\nmore and more accurate information extractors, no work has been devoted to\ninvestigating the effect of the quality of training data on the learning\nprocess. Low quality in training data often derives from the fact that the\nperson who has annotated the data is different from the one against whose\njudgment the automatically annotated data must be evaluated. In this paper we\ntest the impact of such data quality issues on the accuracy of information\nextraction systems as applied to the clinical domain. We do this by comparing\nthe accuracy deriving from training data annotated by the authoritative coder\n(i.e., the one who has also annotated the test data, and by whose judgment we\nmust abide), with the accuracy deriving from training data annotated by a\ndifferent coder. The results indicate that, although the disagreement between\nthe two coders (as measured on the training set) is substantial, the difference\nis (surprisingly enough) not always statistically significant.

So far, quantification has been\naddressed by learning a general-purpose classifier, counting the unlabelled\nitems which have been assigned the class, and tuning the obtained counts\naccording to some heuristics. In this paper we depart from the tradition of\nusing general-purpose classifiers, and use instead a supervised learning model\nfor \\emph{structured prediction}, capable of generating classifiers directly\noptimized for the (multivariate and non-linear) function used for evaluating\nquantification accuracy. The experiments that we have run on 5500 binary\nhigh-dimensional datasets (averaging more than 14,000 documents each) show that\nthis method is more accurate, more stable, and more efficient than existing,\nstate-of-the-art quantification methods.

Conversely, every formula of\nESO[k] with at most k-ary free relation variables can be expressed with a\nformula of INEX[k]. From this it follows that, on the level of sentences,\nINEX[k] captures the expressive power of ESO[k].\n  We also introduce several useful operators that can be expressed in INEX[k].\nIn particular, we define inclusion and exclusion quantifiers and so-called term\nvalue preserving disjunction which is essential for the proofs of the main\nresults in this paper.

Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic\ndifferentiation or simply \"autodiff\", is a family of techniques similar to but\nmore general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating\nderivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small\nbut established field with applications in areas including computational fluid\ndynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very\nrecently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of\neach other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's\nresults. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the\nmachine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption\nunder the names \"dynamic computational graphs\" and \"differentiable\nprogramming\". We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover\napplications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation\ntechniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their\ninterrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms\n\"autodiff\", \"automatic differentiation\", and \"symbolic differentiation\" as\nthese are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.

RFN models\nidentify rare and small events in the input, have a low interference between\ncode units, have a small reconstruction error, and explain the data covariance\nstructure. RFN learning is a generalized alternating minimization algorithm\nderived from the posterior regularization method which enforces non-negative\nand normalized posterior means. We proof convergence and correctness of the RFN\nlearning algorithm. On benchmarks, RFNs are compared to other unsupervised\nmethods like autoencoders, RBMs, factor analysis, ICA, and PCA. In contrast to\nprevious sparse coding methods, RFNs yield sparser codes, capture the data's\ncovariance structure more precisely, and have a significantly smaller\nreconstruction error. We test RFNs as pretraining technique for deep networks\non different vision datasets, where RFNs were superior to RBMs and\nautoencoders. On gene expression data from two pharmaceutical drug discovery\nstudies, RFNs detected small and rare gene modules that revealed highly\nrelevant new biological insights which were so far missed by other unsupervised\nmethods.

Although extensive efforts have been devoted in\nrecent years, most existing works combined multiple video features using simple\nfusion strategies and neglected the utilization of inter-class semantic\nrelationships. This paper proposes a novel unified framework that jointly\nexploits the feature relationships and the class relationships for improved\ncategorization performance. Specifically, these two types of relationships are\nestimated and utilized by rigorously imposing regularizations in the learning\nprocess of a deep neural network (DNN). Such a regularized DNN (rDNN) can be\nefficiently realized using a GPU-based implementation with an affordable\ntraining cost. Through arming the DNN with better capability of harnessing both\nthe feature and the class relationships, the proposed rDNN is more suitable for\nmodeling video semantics. With extensive experimental evaluations, we show that\nrDNN produces superior performance over several state-of-the-art approaches. On\nthe well-known Hollywood2 and Columbia Consumer Video benchmarks, we obtain\nvery competitive results: 66.9\\% and 73.5\\% respectively in terms of mean\naverage precision. In addition, to substantially evaluate our rDNN and\nstimulate future research on large scale video categorization, we collect and\nrelease a new benchmark dataset, called FCVID, which contains 91,223 Internet\nvideos and 239 manually annotated categories.

Imaging\nSci., vol. 7, no. 2, pp. 669--695, 2014] and based upon a semi-discrete\nvariation of the Citti-Petitot-Sarti model of the primary visual cortex V1. The\nAHE algorithm is based on a suitable combination of sub-Riemannian hypoelliptic\ndiffusion and ad-hoc local averaging techniques. In particular, we focus on\nreconstructing highly corrupted images (i.e. where more than the 80% of the\nimage is missing), for which we obtain reconstructions comparable with the\nstate-of-the-art.

These\nnonidentical linear models render control design and coupling conditions highly\ncorrelated if static couplings are used for all individual systems. In this\npaper, a dynamic coupling structure, which incorporates a global weighting\nfactor and a vanishing auxiliary control variable, is proposed for each agent\nand is shown to be a feasible solution. Lower bounds on the global and local\nweighting factors are derived under the condition that every interaction\nsubgraph associated with each cluster admits a directed spanning tree. The\nspanning tree requirement is further shown to be a necessary condition when the\nclusters connect acyclicly with each other. Simulations for two applications,\ncluster heading alignment of nonidentical ships and cluster phase\nsynchronization of nonidentical harmonic oscillators, illustrate essential\nparts of the derived theoretical results.

Let ML(A+)\ndenote the fragment of modal logic extended with the universal modality in\nwhich the universal modality occurs only positively. We show that a class of\nKripke models is definable in ML(A+) if and only if the class is elementary and\nclosed under disjoint unions and surjective bisimulations. We also characterise\nthe definability of ML(A+) in the spirit of the well-known Goldblatt--Thomason\ntheorem. We show that an elementary class F of Kripke frames is definable in\nML(A+) if and only if F is closed under taking generated subframes and bounded\nmorphic images, and reflects ultrafilter extensions and finitely generated\nsubframes. In addition we study frame definability relative to finite\ntransitive frames and give an analogous characterisation of ML(A+)-definability\nrelative to finite transitive frames. Finally, we initiate the study of model\nand frame definability in team-based logics. We study (extended) modal\ndependence logic, (extended) modal inclusion logic, and modal team logic. We\nestablish strict linear hierarchies with respect to model definability and\nframe definability, respectively. We show that, with respect to model and frame\ndefinability, the before mentioned team-based logics, except modal dependence\nlogic, either coincide with ML(A+) or plain modal logic ML. Thus as a corollary\nwe obtain model theoretic characterisation of model and frame definability for\nthe team-based logics. Comment: 30 pages.

In fact the two tasks are often\ninterleaved with each other: noisy and high-dimensional features will bring\nadverse effect on sample selection, while informative or representative samples\nwill be beneficial to feature selection. Specifically, we propose a framework\nto jointly conduct active learning and feature selection based on the CUR\nmatrix decomposition. From the data reconstruction perspective, both the\nselected samples and features can best approximate the original dataset\nrespectively, such that the selected samples characterized by the features are\nhighly representative. In particular, our method runs in one-shot without the\nprocedure of iterative sample selection for progressive labeling. Thus, our\nmodel is especially suitable when there are few labeled samples or even in the\nabsence of supervision, which is a particular challenge for existing methods.\nAs the joint learning problem is NP-hard, the proposed formulation involves a\nconvex but non-smooth optimization problem. We solve it efficiently by an\niterative algorithm, and prove its global convergence. Experimental results on\npublicly available datasets corroborate the efficacy of our method compared\nwith the state-of-the-art. Comment: Accepted by T-PAMI", "1503.01334": "Faster quantum mixing for slowly evolving sequences of Markov chains,Markov chain methods are remarkably successful in computational physics,\nmachine learning, and combinatorial optimization. The cost of such methods\noften reduces to the mixing time, i.e., the time required to reach the steady\nstate of the Markov chain, which scales as $\\delta^{-1}$, the inverse of the\nspectral gap. It has long been conjectured that quantum computers offer nearly\ngeneric quadratic improvements for mixing problems. However, except in special\ncases, quantum algorithms achieve a run-time of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\delta^{-1}}\n\\sqrt{N})$, which introduces a costly dependence on the Markov chain size $N,$\nnot present in the classical case. Here, we re-address the problem of mixing of\nMarkov chains when these form a slowly evolving sequence. This setting is akin\nto the simulated annealing setting and is commonly encountered in physics,\nmaterial sciences and machine learning. We provide a quantum memory-efficient\nalgorithm with a run-time of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\delta^{-1}} \\sqrt[4]{N})$,\nneglecting logarithmic terms, which is an important improvement for large state\nspaces. Moreover, our algorithms output quantum encodings of distributions,\nwhich has advantages over classical outputs. Finally, we discuss the run-time\nbounds of mixing algorithms and show that, under certain assumptions, our\nalgorithms are optimal.

The new examples include split\npermutation graphs and bichain graphs. Each of these classes is characterised\nby a finite list of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs. These, therefore,\ndisprove a conjecture due to Daligault, Rao and Thomasse from 2010 claiming\nthat all such minimal classes must be defined by infinitely many forbidden\ninduced subgraphs.\n  In the same paper, Daligault, Rao and Thomasse make another conjecture that\nevery hereditary class of unbounded clique-width must contain a labelled\ninfinite antichain. We show that the two example classes we consider here\nsatisfy this conjecture. Indeed, they each contain a canonical labelled\ninfinite antichain, which leads us to propose a stronger conjecture: that every\nhereditary class of graphs that is minimal of unbounded clique-width contains a\ncanonical labelled infinite antichain.

Participants in such network\nneed to take decisions daily, both on the quantity of resources to use as well\nas the periods of usage. With this in mind, we discuss the problem of\nincentivizing users to behave in such a way that society as a whole benefits.\nIn order to perceive societal level impact, such incentives may take the form\nof rewarding users with lottery tickets based on good behavior, and\nperiodically conducting a lottery to translate these tickets into real rewards.\nWe will pose the user decision problem as a mean field game (MFG), and the\nincentives question as one of trying to select a good mean field equilibrium\n(MFE). In such a framework, each agent (a participant in the societal network)\ntakes a decision based on an assumed distribution of actions of his/her\ncompetitors, and the incentives provided by the social planner. The system is\nsaid to be at MFE if the agent's action is a sample drawn from the assumed\ndistribution. We will show the existence of such an MFE under different\nsettings, and also illustrate how to choose an attractive equilibrium using as\nan example demand-response in energy networks.

Recent\nworks have leveraged the use of social network-based trust relationships to\ndefend against Sybil attacks. However, existing defenses are based on\noversimplified assumptions, which do not hold in real world social graphs. In\nthis work, we propose SybilFrame, a defense-in-depth framework for mitigating\nthe problem of Sybil attacks when the oversimplified assumptions are relaxed.\nOur framework is able to incorporate prior information about users and edges in\nthe social graph. We validate our framework on synthetic and real world network\ntopologies, including a large-scale Twitter dataset with 20M nodes and 265M\nedges, and demonstrate that our scheme performs an order of magnitude better\nthan previous structure-based approaches.

Software level\nsecurity solutions compromise the performance of virtual machines (VMs), as a\nlarge amount of computational power would be utilized for running the security\nmodules. Moreover, software solutions are only as secure as the level that they\nwork on. For example a security module on a hypervisor cannot provide security\nin the presence of an infected hypervisor. It is a challenge for virtualization\ntechnology architects to enhance the security of VMs without degrading their\nperformance. Currently available server machines are not fully equipped to\nsupport a secure VM environment without compromising on performance. A few\nhardware modifications have been introduced by manufactures like Intel and AMD\nto provide a secure VM environment with low performance degradation. In this\npaper we propose a novel memory architecture model named \\textit{ Architectural\nSupport for Memory Isolation(ASMI)}, that can achieve a true isolated physical\nmemory region to each VM without degrading performance. Along with true memory\nisolation, ASMI is designed to provide lower memory access times, better\nutilization of available memory, support for DMA isolation and support for\nplatform independence for users of VMs. Comment: Rejected this short paper by the VEE 2015 Conference conducted by ACM\n  due to the lack of implementation details", "1503.03185": "Testing Randomness by Matching Pennies,In the game of Matching Pennies, Alice and Bob each hold a penny, and at\nevery tick of the clock they simultaneously display the head or the tail sides\nof their coins. If they both display the same side, then Alice wins Bob's\npenny; if they display different sides, then Bob wins Alice's penny. To avoid\ngiving the opponent a chance to win, both players seem to have nothing else to\ndo but to randomly play heads and tails with equal frequencies. However, while\nnot losing in this game is easy, not missing an opportunity to win is not.\nRandomizing your own moves can be made easy. Recognizing when the opponent's\nmoves are not random can be arbitrarily hard.\n  The notion of randomness is central in game theory, but it is usually taken\nfor granted. The notion of outsmarting is not central in game theory, but it is\ncentral in the practice of gaming. We pursue the idea that these two notions\ncan be usefully viewed as two sides of the same coin.

An improved form of the implicit return-mapping scheme\nfor nonsmooth yield surfaces is proposed that systematically builds on a\nsubdifferential formulation of the flow rule. The main advantage of this\napproach is that the treatment of singular points, such as apices or edges at\nwhich the flow direction is multivalued involves only a uniquely defined set of\nnon-linear equations, similarly to smooth yield surfaces. This paper (PART I)\nis focused on isotropic models containing: $a)$ yield surfaces with one or two\napices (singular points) laying on the hydrostatic axis; $b)$ plastic\npseudo-potentials that are independent of the Lode angle; $c)$ nonlinear\nisotropic hardening (optionally). It is shown that for some models the improved\nintegration scheme also enables to a priori decide about a type of the return\nand investigate existence, uniqueness and semismoothness of discretized\nconstitutive operators in implicit form. Further, the semismooth Newton method\nis introduced to solve incremental boundary-value problems. The paper also\ncontains numerical examples related to slope stability with available Matlab\nimplementation.

Sci.\nComput., 18 (1997), pp.~838--853.], is based on the F-norm minimization and\ncomputes a sparse approximate inverse $M$ of a large sparse matrix $A$\nadaptively. However, SPAI may be costly to seek the most profitable indices at\neach loop and $M$ may be ineffective for preconditioning. In this paper, we\npropose a residual based sparse approximate inverse preconditioning procedure\n(RSAI), which, unlike SPAI, is based on only the {\\em dominant} rather than all\ninformation on the current residual and augments sparsity patterns adaptively\nduring the loops. RSAI is less costly to seek indices and is more effective to\ncapture a good approximate sparsity pattern of $A^{-1}$ than SPAI. To control\nthe sparsity of $M$ and reduce computational cost, we develop a practical\nRSAI($tol$) algorithm that drops small nonzero entries adaptively during the\nprocess. Numerical experiments are reported to demonstrate that RSAI($tol$) is\nat least competitive with SPAI and can be considerably more efficient and\neffective than SPAI. They also indicate that RSAI($tol$) is comparable to the\nPSAI($tol$) algorithm proposed by one of the authors in 2009.

Large-scale meta-database\nmanagement is therefore an important challenge for production platforms\nproviding services for biological data analysis. In particular, there is often\na need either to run an analysis with a particular version of a meta-database,\nor to rerun an analysis with an updated meta-database. We present our GeStore\napproach for biological meta-database management. It provides efficient storage\nand runtime generation of specific meta-database versions, and efficient\nincremental updates for biological data analysis tools. The approach is\ntransparent to the tools, and we provide a framework that makes it easy to\nintegrate GeStore with biological data analysis frameworks. We present the\nGeStore system, an evaluation of the performance characteristics of the system,\nand an evaluation of the benefits for a biological data analysis workflow.

Most of the prior work on MAB assumes that\nthe reward distributions of each arm are independent. But in a wide variety of\ndecision problems -- from drug dosage to dynamic pricing -- the expected\nrewards of different arms are correlated, so that selecting one arm provides\ninformation about the expected rewards of other arms as well. We propose and\nanalyze a class of models of such decision problems, which we call {\\em global\nbandits}. In the case in which rewards of all arms are deterministic functions\nof a single unknown parameter, we construct a greedy policy that achieves {\\em\nbounded regret}, with a bound that depends on the single true parameter of the\nproblem. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only finitely many times\nwith probability one. For this case we also obtain a bound on regret that is\n{\\em independent of the true parameter}; this bound is sub-linear, with an\nexponent that depends on the informativeness of the arms. We also propose a\nvariant of the greedy policy that achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$\nworst-case and $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ parameter dependent regret. Finally, we perform\nexperiments on dynamic pricing and show that the proposed algorithms achieve\nsignificant gains with respect to the well-known benchmarks.

Our GoI dynamically captures HvG's\ngeometric correctness criterion-the toggling cycle condition-in terms of\nalgebraic operators. Our new ingredient is a scalar extension of the *-algebra\nin Girard's *-ring of partial isometries over a boolean polynomial ring with\nliterals of eigenweights as indeterminates. In order to capture feedback\narising from cuts, we construct a finer grained execution formula. The\nexpansion of this execution formula is longer than that for collections of\nslices for multiplicative GoI, hence it is harder to prove termination. Our GoI\ngives a dynamical, semantical account of boolean valuations (in particular,\npruning sub-proofs), conversion of weights (in particular, alpha-conversion),\nand additive (co)contraction, peculiar to additive proof-theory. Termination of\nour execution formula is shown to correspond to HvG's toggling criterion. The\nslice-wise restriction of our execution formula (by collapsing the boolean\nstructure) yields the well known correspondence, explicit or implicit in\nprevious works on multiplicative GoI, between the convergence of execution\nformulas and acyclicity of proof-nets. Feedback arising from the execution\nformula by restricting to the boolean polynomial structure yields autonomous\ndefinability of eigenweights among cuts from the rest of the eigenweights.

This paper studies the\nconcept of complete simulation in the context of semigroups of transformations\nof $A^n$, also known as finite state-homogeneous automata networks. For $m \\geq\nn$, a transformation of $A^m$ is \\emph{$n$-complete of size $m$} if it may\nsimulate every transformation of $A^n$ by updating one coordinate (or register)\nat a time. Using tools from memoryless computation, it is established that\nthere is no $n$-complete transformation of size $n$, but there is such a\ntransformation of size $n+1$. By studying the the time of simulation of various\n$n$-complete transformations, it is conjectured that the maximal time of\nsimulation of any $n$-complete transformation is at least $2n$. A\ntransformation of $A^m$ is \\emph{sequentially $n$-complete of size $m$} if it\nmay sequentially simulate every finite sequence of transformations of $A^n$; in\nthis case, minimal examples and bounds for the size and time of simulation are\ndetermined. It is also shown that there is no $n$-complete transformation that\nupdates all the registers in parallel, but that there exists a sequentally\n$n$-complete transformation that updates all but one register in parallel. This\nillustrates the strengths and weaknesses of parallel models of computation,\nsuch as cellular automata.

In this\npaper, the distribution of linear combination of complex Wishart distributed\nmatrices has been studied. We present a new closed form expression for the\nmarginal distribution of the eigenvalues of a weighted sum of K complex central\nWishart matrices having covariance matrices proportional to the identity\nmatrix. The expression is general and allows for any set of linear\ncoefficients. As an application example, we have used the marginal distribution\nexpression to obtain the ergodic sum-rate capacity for the MIMO-MAC network,\nand the cut-set upper bound for the MIMO-Relay case, both as closed form\nexpressions. We also present a very simple expression to approximate the sum of\nWishart matrices by one equivalent Wishart matrix. All of our results are\nvalidated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. As expected, the agreement\nbetween the exact eigenvalue distribution and simulations is perfect, whereas\nfor the approximate solution the difference is indistinguishable.

We focus on regular-LDPC codes and iterative message-passing decoders. We\nanalyze scaling behavior under two VLSI complexity models of decoding. One\nmodel abstracts power consumed in processing elements (\"node model\"), and\nanother abstracts power consumed in wires which connect the processing elements\n(\"wire model\"). We prove that a coding strategy using regular-LDPC codes with\nGallager-B decoding achieves order-optimal scaling of total power under the\nnode model. However, we also prove that regular-LDPC codes and iterative\nmessage-passing decoders cannot meet existing fundamental limits on total power\nunder the wire model. Further, if the transmit energy-per-bit is bounded, total\npower grows at a rate that is worse than uncoded transmission. Complementing\nour theoretical results, we develop detailed physical models of decoding\nimplementations using post-layout circuit simulations. Our theoretical and\nnumerical results show that approaching fundamental limits on total power\nrequires increasing the complexity of both the code design and the\ncorresponding decoding algorithm as communication distance is increased or\nerror-probability is lowered.

In this work, we are interested in\nstrategies of Eve that minimize her regret, i.e. strategies that minimize the\ndifference between her actual payoff and the payoff she could have achieved if\nshe had known the strategy of Adam in advance. We give algorithms to compute\nthe strategies of Eve that ensure minimal regret against an adversary whose\nchoice of strategy is (i) unrestricted, (ii) limited to positional strategies,\nor (iii) limited to word strategies.

However, falling\nis a short term activity that occurs infrequently. This poses a challenge to\ntraditional classification algorithms, because there may be very little\ntraining data for falls (or none at all). This paper proposes an approach for\nthe identification of falls using a wearable device in the absence of training\ndata for falls but with plentiful data for normal ADL. We propose three\n`X-Factor' Hidden Markov Model (XHMMs) approaches. The XHMMs model unseen falls\nusing \"inflated\" output covariances (observation models). To estimate the\ninflated covariances, we propose a novel cross validation method to remove\n\"outliers\" from the normal ADL that serve as proxies for the unseen falls and\nallow learning the XHMMs using only normal activities. We tested the proposed\nXHMM approaches on two activity recognition datasets and show high detection\nrates for falls in the absence of fall-specific training data. We show that the\ntraditional method of choosing a threshold based on maximum of negative of\nlog-likelihood to identify unseen falls is ill-posed for this problem. We also\nshow that supervised classification methods perform poorly when very limited\nfall data are available during the training phase.

Lascoux and M. Sch\\\"utzenberger in\nthe study of cohomology rings of flag manifolds in 1980's. These polynomials\ngeneralize Schur polynomials, and form a linear basis of multivariate\npolynomials. In 2003, Lenart and Sottile introduced skew Schubert polynomials,\nwhich generalize skew Schur polynomials, and expand in the Schubert basis with\nthe generalized Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.\n  In this paper we initiate the study of these two families of polynomials from\nthe perspective of computational complexity theory. We first observe that skew\nSchubert polynomials, and therefore Schubert polynomials, are in $\\CountP$\n(when evaluating on non-negative integral inputs) and $\\VNP$.\n  Our main result is a deterministic algorithm that computes the expansion of a\npolynomial $f$ of degree $d$ in $\\Z[x_1, \\dots, x_n]$ in the basis of Schubert\npolynomials, assuming an oracle computing Schubert polynomials. This algorithm\nruns in time polynomial in $n$, $d$, and the bit size of the expansion. This\ngeneralizes, and derandomizes, the sparse interpolation algorithm of symmetric\npolynomials in the Schur basis by Barvinok and Fomin (Advances in Applied\nMathematics, 18(3):271--285). In fact, our interpolation algorithm is general\nenough to accommodate any linear basis satisfying certain natural properties.\n  Applications of the above results include a new algorithm that computes the\ngeneralized Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.

We discuss how the semidefinite programming formulations of\ncheating strategies can be reduced to optimizing a linear combination of\nfidelity functions over a polytope. These turn out to be much simpler\nsemidefinite programs which can be modelled using second-order cone programming\nproblems. We then use these simplifications to construct their point games as\ndeveloped by Kitaev. We also study the classical version of these protocols and\nuse linear optimization to formulate optimal cheating strategies. We then\nconstruct the point games for the classical protocols as well using the\nanalysis for the quantum case.\n  We discuss the philosophical connections between the classical and quantum\nprotocols and their point games as viewed from optimization theory. In\nparticular, we observe an analogy between a spectrum of physical theories (from\nclassical to quantum) and a spectrum of convex optimization problems (from\nlinear programming to semidefinite programming, through second-order cone\nprogramming). In this analogy, classical systems correspond to linear\nprogramming problems and the level of quantum features in the system is\ncorrelated to the level of sophistication of the semidefinite programming\nmodels on the optimization side.\n  Concerning security analysis, we use the classical point games to prove that\nevery classical protocol of this type allows exactly one of the parties to\nentirely determine the coin-flip. Using the relationships between the quantum\nand classical protocols, we show that only \"classical\" protocols can saturate\nKitaev's lower bound for strong coin-flipping. Moreover, if the product of\nAlice and Bob's optimal cheating probabilities is 1/2, then one party can cheat\nwith probability 1. This rules out quantum protocols of this type from\nattaining the optimal level of security. Comment: 41 pages (plus a 17 page appendix).

If the difference between cardinalities of any two total\nindependent sets is at most one, then the minimum number of total independent\npartition sets of $V \\cup E$ is called the \\emph{equitable total chromatic\nnumber}, and is denoted by $\\chi''_=(G)$.\n  In this paper we consider equitable total coloring of coronas of cubic\ngraphs, $G \\circ H$.

Latent in this data are inspiring insights\nabout human actions and behaviors, the discovery of which is important because\ncontext-aware applications and services hold the key to user-driven,\nintelligent services, which can enhance our everyday lives such as social and\neconomic development, urban planning, and health prevention. The major\nchallenge in this area is that interpreting such a big stream of data requires\na deep understanding of mobile network events' context through available\nbackground knowledge. This article addresses the issues in context awareness\ngiven heterogeneous and uncertain data of mobile network events missing\nreliable information on the context of this activity. The contribution of this\nresearch is a model from a combination of logical and statistical reasoning\nstandpoints for enabling human activity inference in qualitative terms from\nopen geographical data that aimed at improving the quality of human behaviors\nrecognition tasks from CDRs. We use open geographical data, Openstreetmap\n(OSM), as a proxy for predicting the content of human activity in the area. The\nuser study performed in Trento shows that predicted human activities (top\nlevel) match the survey data with around 93% overall accuracy. The extensive\nvalidation for predicting a more specific economic type of human activity\nperformed in Barcelona, by employing credit card transaction data. The analysis\nidentifies that appropriately normalized data on points of interest (POI) is a\ngood proxy for predicting human economical activities, with 84% accuracy on\naverage. So the model is proven to be efficient for predicting the context of\nhuman activity, when its total level could be efficiently observed from cell\nphone data records, missing contextual information however.

Analyzing this class of algorithms is important, since many\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can be cast as SAs driven by a\n`controlled Markov' process. In this paper, we present easily verifiable\nsufficient conditions for stability and convergence of SAs driven by a\n`controlled Markov' process. Many RL applications involve continuous state\nspaces. While our analysis readily ensures stability for such continuous state\napplications, traditional analyses do not. As compared to literature, our\nanalysis presents a two-fold generalization (a) the Markov process may evolve\nin a continuous state space and (b) the process need not be ergodic under any\ngiven stationary policy. Temporal difference learning (TD) is an important\npolicy evaluation method in reinforcement learning. The theory developed\nherein, is used to analyze generalized $TD(0)$, an important variant of TD. Our\ntheory is also used to analyze a TD formulation of supervised learning for\nforecasting problems.

The previous\nfastest algorithm for SSR and SSSP goes back three decades to Even and Shiloach\n[JACM 1981]; it has $ O(1) $ query time and $ O (mn) $ total update time (i.e.,\nlinear amortized update time if all edges are deleted). This algorithm serves\nas a building block for several other dynamic algorithms. The question whether\nits total update time can be improved is a major, long standing, open problem.\n  In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively. We obtain a randomized\nalgorithm with an expected total update time of $ O(\\min (m^{7/6} n^{2/3 +\no(1)}, m^{3/4} n^{5/4 + o(1)}) ) = O (m n^{9/10 + o(1)}) $ for SSR and\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate SSSP if the edge weights are integers from $ 1 $ to\n$ W \\leq 2^{\\log^c{n}} $ and $ \\epsilon \\geq 1 / \\log^c{n} $ for some constant\n$ c $. We also extend our algorithm to achieve roughly the same running time\nfor Strongly Connected Components (SCC), improving the algorithm of Roditty and\nZwick [FOCS 2002]. Our algorithm is most efficient for sparse and dense graphs.\nWhen $ m = \\Theta(n) $ its running time is $ O (n^{1 + 5/6 + o(1)}) $ and when\n$ m = \\Theta(n^2) $ its running time is $ O (n^{2 + 3/4 + o(1)}) $. For SSR we\nalso obtain an algorithm that is faster for dense graphs and has a total update\ntime of $ O ( m^{2/3} n^{4/3 + o(1)} + m^{3/7} n^{12/7 + o(1)}) $ which is $ O\n(n^{2 + 2/3}) $ when $ m = \\Theta(n^2) $. All our algorithms have constant\nquery time in the worst case and are correct with high probability against an\noblivious adversary.

For example, $F$-measure is a commonly used performance\nmeasure for classification problems in machine learning and information\nretrieval community. We study the theoretical properties of a subset of\nnon-linear performance measures called pseudo-linear performance measures which\nincludes $F$-measure, \\emph{Jaccard Index}, among many others. We establish\nthat many notions of $F$-measures and \\emph{Jaccard Index} are pseudo-linear\nfunctions of the per-class false negatives and false positives for binary,\nmulticlass and multilabel classification. Based on this observation, we present\na general reduction of such performance measure optimization problem to\ncost-sensitive classification problem with unknown costs. We then propose an\nalgorithm with provable guarantees to obtain an approximately optimal\nclassifier for the $F$-measure by solving a series of cost-sensitive\nclassification problems. The strength of our analysis is to be valid on any\ndataset and any class of classifiers, extending the existing theoretical\nresults on pseudo-linear measures, which are asymptotic in nature. We also\nestablish the multi-objective nature of the $F$-score maximization problem by\nlinking the algorithm with the weighted-sum approach used in multi-objective\noptimization. We present numerical experiments to illustrate the relative\nimportance of cost asymmetry and thresholding when learning linear classifiers\non various $F$-measure optimization tasks.

Low-rank matrix approximation algorithms are widely used to\naddress this problem and reduce the arithmetic and storage cost. However, we\nobserved that for some datasets with wide intra-class variability, the optimal\nkernel parameter for smaller classes yields a matrix that is less well\napproximated by low-rank methods. In this paper, we propose an efficient\nstructured low-rank approximation method---the Block Basis Factorization\n(BBF)---and its fast construction algorithm to approximate radial basis\nfunction (RBF) kernel matrices. Our approach has linear memory cost and\nfloating point operations. BBF works for a wide range of kernel bandwidth\nparameters and extends the domain of applicability of low-rank approximation\nmethods significantly. Our empirical results demonstrate the stability and\nsuperiority over the state-of-art kernel approximation algorithms.

First, a quadratic programming problem\nis formulated to design beam patterns by using the criteria for a minimal\nintegrated side-lobe level. A theorem is derived that provides a closed-form\nanalytical optimal solution that appears to be an extension of the Rayleigh\nquotient minimization for a possibly singular matrix in quadratic form. Such\nsingularities are shown to occur in the problem of interest, but proofs for the\noptimum solution in these singular matrix cases could not be found in the\nliterature. Next, an additional constraint is added to obtain beam patterns\nwith desired 3 dB beamwidths, resulting in a nonconvex quadratically\nconstrained quadratic program which is NP-hard. A semidefinite program and a\nGaussian randomized semidefinite relaxation are used to determine feasible\nsolutions arbitrarily close to the solution to the original problem.\nTheoretical and numerical analyses illustrate the impacts of changing the\nnumber of transmitters and orthogonal waveforms employed in the designs.\nNumerical comparisons are conducted to evaluate the proposed design approaches.

This paper investigates multi-target tracking in distributed\nsensor networks. Data association, which arises particularly in multi-object\nscenarios, can be tackled by various solutions. We consider sequential Monte\nCarlo implementations of the Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter based\non random finite sets. This approach circumvents the data association issue by\njointly estimating all targets in the region of interest. To this end, we\ndevelop the Diffusion Particle PHD Filter (D-PPHDF) as well as a centralized\nversion, called the Multi-Sensor Particle PHD Filter (MS-PPHDF). Their\nperformance is evaluated in terms of the Optimal Subpattern Assignment (OSPA)\nmetric, benchmarked against a distributed extension of the Posterior\nCram\\'er-Rao Lower Bound (PCRLB), and compared to the performance of an\nexisting distributed PHD Particle Filter. Furthermore, the robustness of the\nproposed tracking algorithms against outliers and their performance with\nrespect to different amounts of clutter is investigated.

A common strategy is to evaluate a measure of\ndependence on every variable pair and retain the highest-scoring pairs for\nfollow-up. This strategy works well if the statistic used is equitable [Reshef\net al. 2015a], i.e., if, for some measure of noise, it assigns similar scores\nto equally noisy relationships regardless of relationship type (e.g., linear,\nexponential, periodic).\n  In this paper, we introduce and characterize a population measure of\ndependence called MIC*. We show three ways that MIC* can be viewed: as the\npopulation value of MIC, a highly equitable statistic from [Reshef et al.\n2011], as a canonical \"smoothing\" of mutual information, and as the supremum of\nan infinite sequence defined in terms of optimal one-dimensional partitions of\nthe marginals of the joint distribution. Based on this theory, we introduce an\nefficient approach for computing MIC* from the density of a pair of random\nvariables, and we define a new consistent estimator MICe for MIC* that is\nefficiently computable. In contrast, there is no known polynomial-time\nalgorithm for computing the original equitable statistic MIC. We show through\nsimulations that MICe has better bias-variance properties than MIC. We then\nintroduce and prove the consistency of a second statistic, TICe, that is a\ntrivial side-product of the computation of MICe and whose goal is powerful\nindependence testing rather than equitability.\n  We show in simulations that MICe and TICe have good equitability and power\nagainst independence respectively. The analyses here complement a more in-depth\nempirical evaluation of several leading measures of dependence [Reshef et al.\n2015b] that shows state-of-the-art performance for MICe and TICe.

This can be accomplished by computing a measure\nof dependence on all variable pairs and examining the highest-scoring pairs,\nprovided the measure of dependence used assigns similar scores to equally noisy\nrelationships of different types. This property, called equitability, is\nformalized in Reshef et al. [2015b]. In addition to equitability, measures of\ndependence can also be assessed by the power of their corresponding\nindependence tests as well as their runtime.\n  Here we present extensive empirical evaluation of the equitability, power\nagainst independence, and runtime of several leading measures of dependence.\nThese include two statistics introduced in Reshef et al. [2015a]: MICe, which\nhas equitability as its primary goal, and TICe, which has power against\nindependence as its goal. Regarding equitability, our analysis finds that MICe\nis the most equitable method on functional relationships in most of the\nsettings we considered, although mutual information estimation proves the most\nequitable at large sample sizes in some specific settings. Regarding power\nagainst independence, we find that TICe, along with Heller and Gorfine's S^DDP,\nis the state of the art on the relationships we tested. Our analyses also show\na trade-off between power against independence and equitability consistent with\nthe theory in Reshef et al. [2015b]. In terms of runtime, MICe and TICe are\nsignificantly faster than many other measures of dependence tested, and\ncomputing either one makes computing the other trivial. This suggests that a\nfast and useful strategy for achieving a combination of power against\nindependence and equitability may be to filter relationships by TICe and then\nto examine the MICe of only the significant ones.

Based on this model, the problem of\nnetwork evolution (NE) is defined formally as an optimization problem and\nsubsequently proven to be fundamentally hard (NP-hard) by means of reduction\nfrom the Knapsack problem (KP). Second, for empirical validation, various\nbiological networks of experimentally-validated interactions are compared\nagainst randomly generated networks with varying degree distributions. An NE\ninstance is created using a given real or synthetic (random) network. After\nbeing reverse-reduced to a KP instance, each NE instance is fed to a KP solver\nand the average achieved knapsack value-to-weight ratio is recorded from\nmultiple rounds of simulated evolutionary pressure. The results show that\nbiological networks (and synthetic networks of similar degree distribution)\nachieve the highest ratios at maximal evolutionary pressure and minimal error\ntolerance conditions. The more distant (in degree distribution) a synthetic\nnetwork is from biological networks the lower its achieved ratio. The results\nshed light on how computational intractability has shaped the evolution of\nbiological networks into their current topology.

Updates should be performed consistently,\npreventing temporary disruptions, and should require as little overhead as\npossible. Scalability is increasingly becoming an essential requirement in SDN.\nIn this paper we propose to use time-triggered network updates to achieve\nconsistent updates. Our proposed solution requires lower overhead than existing\nupdate approaches, without compromising the consistency during the update. We\ndemonstrate that accurate time enables far more scalable consistent updates in\nSDN than previously available. In addition, it provides the SDN programmer with\nfine-grained control over the tradeoff between consistency and scalability. Comment: This technical report is an extended version of the paper \"Timed\n  Consistent Network Updates\", which was accepted to the ACM SIGCOMM Symposium\n  on SDN Research (SOSR) '15, Santa Clara, CA, US, June 2015", "1505.03898": "Pinball Loss Minimization for One-bit Compressive Sensing: Convex Models\n  and Algorithms,The one-bit quantization is implemented by one single comparator that\noperates at low power and a high rate. Hence one-bit compressive sensing\n(1bit-CS) becomes attractive in signal processing. When measurements are\ncorrupted by noise during signal acquisition and transmission, 1bit-CS is\nusually modeled as minimizing a loss function with a sparsity constraint. The\none-sided $\\ell_1$ loss and the linear loss are two popular loss functions for\n1bit-CS. To improve the decoding performance on noisy data, we consider the\npinball loss, which provides a bridge between the one-sided $\\ell_1$ loss and\nthe linear loss. Using the pinball loss, two convex models, an elastic-net\npinball model and its modification with the $\\ell_1$-norm constraint, are\nproposed. To efficiently solve them, the corresponding dual coordinate ascent\nalgorithms are designed and their convergence is proved. The numerical\nexperiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and the\nperformance of the pinball loss minimization for 1bit-CS.

Column subset selection has\nbeen applied to numerous real-world data applications such as population\ngenetics summarization, electronic circuits testing and recommendation systems.\nIn many applications the complete data matrix is unavailable and one needs to\nselect representative columns by inspecting only a small portion of the input\nmatrix. In this paper we propose the first provably correct column subset\nselection algorithms for partially observed data matrices. Our proposed\nalgorithms exhibit different merits and limitations in terms of statistical\naccuracy, computational efficiency, sample complexity and sampling schemes,\nwhich provides a nice exploration of the tradeoff between these desired\nproperties for column subset selection. The proposed methods employ the idea of\nfeedback driven sampling and are inspired by several sampling schemes\npreviously introduced for low-rank matrix approximation tasks (Drineas et al.,\n2008; Frieze et al., 2004; Deshpande and Vempala, 2006; Krishnamurthy and\nSingh, 2014). Our analysis shows that, under the assumption that the input data\nmatrix has incoherent rows but possibly coherent columns, all algorithms\nprovably converge to the best low-rank approximation of the original data as\nnumber of selected columns increases. Furthermore, two of the proposed\nalgorithms enjoy a relative error bound, which is preferred for column subset\nselection and matrix approximation purposes. We also demonstrate through both\ntheoretical and empirical analysis the power of feedback driven sampling\ncompared to uniform random sampling on input matrices with highly correlated\ncolumns.

In practice, many\npublished genome sequences remain in the state of a large set of contigs. Each\ncontig describes the sequence found along some path of the assembly graph,\nhowever, the set of contigs does not record all the sequence information\ncontained in that graph. Although many subsequent analyses can be performed\nwith the set of contigs, one may ask whether mapping reads on the contigs is as\ninformative as mapping them on the paths of the assembly graph. Currently, one\nlacks practical tools to perform mapping on such graphs. Results Here, we\npropose a formal definition of mapping on a de Bruijn graph, analyse the\nproblem complexity which turns out to be NP-complete, and provide a practical\nsolution.We propose a pipeline called GGMAP (Greedy Graph MAPping). Its novelty\nis a procedure to map reads on branching paths of the graph, for which we\ndesigned a heuristic algorithm called BGREAT (de Bruijn Graph REAd mapping\nTool). For the sake of efficiency, BGREAT rewrites a read sequence as a\nsuccession of unitigs sequences. GGMAP can map millions of reads per CPU hour\non a de Bruijn graph built from a large set of human genomic reads.\nSurprisingly, results show that up to 22% more reads can be mapped on the graph\nbut not on the contig set. Conclusions Although mapping reads on a de Bruijn\ngraph is complex task, our proposal offers a practical solution combining\nefficiency with an improved mapping capacity compared to assembly-based mapping\neven for complex eukaryotic data.

These single-cell measurements provide snapshots of the\nstates of the cells that make up a tissue, instead of the population-level\naverages provided by conventional high-throughput experiments. This new data\ntherefore provides an exciting opportunity for computational modelling. In this\npaper we introduce the idea of viewing single-cell gene expression profiles as\nstates of an asynchronous Boolean network, and frame model inference as the\nproblem of reconstructing a Boolean network from its state space. We then give\na scalable algorithm to solve this synthesis problem. We apply our technique to\nboth simulated and real data. We first apply our technique to data simulated\nfrom a well established model of common myeloid progenitor differentiation. We\nshow that our technique is able to recover the original Boolean network rules.\nWe then apply our technique to a large dataset taken during embryonic\ndevelopment containing thousands of cell measurements. Our technique\nsynthesises matching Boolean networks, and analysis of these models yields new\npredictions about blood development which our experimental collaborators were\nable to verify.

The sensors observe random samples in parallel and communicate with a\nfusion center, who makes the global decision based on the sensor inputs. On one\nhand, in the centralized scenario, where local samples are precisely\ntransmitted to the fusion center, the generalized sequential likelihood ratio\ntest (GSPRT) is shown to be asymptotically optimal in terms of the expected\nsample size as error rates tend to zero. On the other hand, for systems with\nlimited power and bandwidth resources, decentralized solutions that only send a\nsummary of local samples (we particularly focus on a one-bit communication\nprotocol) to the fusion center is of great importance. To this end, we first\nconsider a decentralized scheme where sensors send their one-bit quantized\nstatistics every fixed period of time to the fusion center. We show that such a\nuniform sampling and quantization scheme is strictly suboptimal and its\nsuboptimality can be quantified by the KL divergence of the distributions of\nthe quantized statistics under both hypotheses. We then propose a decentralized\nGSPRT based on level-triggered sampling. That is, each sensor runs its own\nGSPRT repeatedly and reports its local decision to the fusion center\nasynchronously. We show that this scheme is asymptotically optimal as the local\nthresholds and global thresholds grow large at different rates. Lastly, two\nparticular models and their associated applications are studied to compare the\ncentralized and decentralized approaches. Numerical results are provided to\ndemonstrate that the proposed level-triggered sampling based decentralized\nscheme aligns closely with the centralized scheme with substantially lower\ncommunication overhead, and significantly outperforms the uniform sampling and\nquantization based decentralized scheme.

Given a graph $G$, a\ncollection of $k$-bend paths in which each path corresponds to a vertex in $G$\nand two paths have a common point if and only if the vertices corresponding to\nthem are adjacent in $G$ is called a $B_k$-VPG representation of $G$.\nSimilarly, a collection of $k$-bend paths each of which corresponds to a vertex\nin $G$ is called an $B_k$-EPG representation of $G$ if any two paths have a\nline segment of non-zero length in common if and only if their corresponding\nvertices are adjacent in $G$. The VPG bend-number $b_v(G)$ of a graph $G$ is\nthe minimum $k$ such that $G$ has a $B_k$-VPG representation. Similarly, the\nEPG bend-number $b_e(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ has a\n$B_k$-EPG representation. Halin graphs are the graphs formed by taking a tree\nwith no degree $2$ vertex and then connecting its leaves to form a cycle in\nsuch a way that the graph has a planar embedding. We prove that if $G$ is a\nHalin graph then $b_v(G) \\leq 1$ and $b_e(G) \\leq 2$. These bounds are tight.\nIn fact, we prove the stronger result that if $G$ is a planar graph formed by\nconnecting the leaves of any tree to form a simple cycle, then it has a\nVPG-representation using only one type of 1-bend paths and an\nEPG-representation using only one type of 2-bend paths.

Comment: Submitted", "1505.06819": "Coalgebraic Infinite Traces and Kleisli Simulations,Kleisli simulation is a categorical notion introduced by Hasuo to verify\nfinite trace inclusion. They allow us to give definitions of forward and\nbackward simulation for various types of systems. A generic categorical theory\nbehind Kleisli simulation has been developed and it guarantees the soundness of\nthose simulations with respect to finite trace semantics. Moreover, those\nsimulations can be aided by forward partial execution (FPE)---a categorical\ntransformation of systems previously introduced by the authors.\n  In this paper, we give Kleisli simulation a theoretical foundation that\nassures its soundness also with respect to infinitary traces. There, following\nJacobs' work, infinitary trace semantics is characterized as the \"largest\nhomomorphism.\" It turns out that soundness of forward simulations is rather\nstraightforward; that of backward simulation holds too, although it requires\ncertain additional conditions and its proof is more involved. We also show that\nFPE can be successfully employed in the infinitary trace setting to enhance the\napplicability of Kleisli simulations as witnesses of trace inclusion. Our\nframework is parameterized in the monad for branching as well as in the functor\nfor linear-time behaviors; for the former we mainly use the powerset monad (for\nnondeterminism), the sub-Giry monad (for probability), and the lift monad (for\nexception).

Its high level of abstraction makes it appealing for concurrent\napplications in parallel and distributed systems. However, designing a\nreal-world actor framework that subsumes full scalability, strong reliability,\nand high resource efficiency requires many conceptual and algorithmic additives\nto the original model.\n  In this paper, we report on designing and building CAF, the \"C++ Actor\nFramework\". CAF targets at providing a concurrent and distributed native\nenvironment for scaling up to very large, high-performance applications, and\nequally well down to small constrained systems. We present the key\nspecifications and design concepts---in particular a message-transparent\narchitecture, type-safe message interfaces, and pattern matching\nfacilities---that make native actors a viable approach for many robust,\nelastic, and highly distributed developments. We demonstrate the feasibility of\nCAF in three scenarios: first for elastic, upscaling environments, second for\nincluding heterogeneous hardware like GPGPUs, and third for distributed runtime\nsystems. Extensive performance evaluations indicate ideal runtime behaviour for\nup to 64 cores at very low memory footprint, or in the presence of GPUs. In\nthese tests, CAF continuously outperforms the competing actor environments\nErlang, Charm++, SalsaLite, Scala, ActorFoundry, and even the OpenMPI.

We also construct\nexamples which show that this inequality is best possible. We consider the\nproof of the upper bound to be fairly elegant and relatively compact. However,\nwe know of no simple proof for the lower bound, and our argument requires a\npowerful tool known as the Product Ramsey Theorem.

More\nspecifically, we present a generic method for converting any selection\nprotocol, into another selection protocol where each message is ``short'' while\npreserving the same number of rounds, the same output distribution, and the\nsame resilience to error. Assuming that the output of the protocol lies in some\nuniverse of size $M$, in our resulting protocol each message consists of only\n$\\mathsf{polylog}(M,n,d)$ many bits, where $n$ is the number of parties and $d$\nis the number of rounds.

Optim., 22(2), 2012], who showed that a random-coordinate selection\nrule achieves the same convergence rate as the Gauss-Southwell selection rule.\nThis result suggests that we should never use the Gauss-Southwell rule, as it\nis typically much more expensive than random selection. However, the empirical\nbehaviours of these algorithms contradict this theoretical result: in\napplications where the computational costs of the selection rules are\ncomparable, the Gauss-Southwell selection rule tends to perform substantially\nbetter than random coordinate selection. We give a simple analysis of the\nGauss-Southwell rule showing that---except in extreme cases---its convergence\nrate is faster than choosing random coordinates. Further, in this work we (i)\nshow that exact coordinate optimization improves the convergence rate for\ncertain sparse problems, (ii) propose a Gauss-Southwell-Lipschitz rule that\ngives an even faster convergence rate given knowledge of the Lipschitz\nconstants of the partial derivatives, (iii) analyze the effect of approximate\nGauss-Southwell rules, and (iv) analyze proximal-gradient variants of the\nGauss-Southwell rule.

The\nrecording experiments are performed with a static tester and conventional\nhard-disk-drive heads. As the reader dimensions are larger than the bit\ndimensions in both the down-track and the cross-track directions, a\ntwo-dimensional bit decoding algorithm is required. Two such algorithms are\npresented in details together with the methodology implemented to accurately\nretrieve island positions during recording.

For example, laboratory results from\ndifferent medical examinations are available for disease diagnosis, and each of\nthem can only reflect the health state of a person from a particular\naspect/view. Therefore, different views provide complementary information for\nlearning tasks. An effective integration of the multi-view information is\nexpected to facilitate the learning performance. In this paper, we propose a\ngeneral predictor, named multi-view machines (MVMs), that can effectively\ninclude all the possible interactions between features from multiple views. A\njoint factorization is embedded for the full-order interaction parameters which\nallows parameter estimation under sparsity. Moreover, MVMs can work in\nconjunction with different loss functions for a variety of machine learning\ntasks. A stochastic gradient descent method is presented to learn the MVM\nmodel. We further illustrate the advantages of MVMs through comparison with\nother methods for multi-view classification, including support vector machines\n(SVMs), support tensor machines (STMs) and factorization machines (FMs). Comment: WSDM 2016", "1506.01634": "Signs of universality in the structure of culture,Understanding the dynamics of opinions, preferences and of culture as whole\nrequires more use of empirical data than has been done so far. It is clear that\nan important role in driving this dynamics is played by social influence, which\nis the essential ingredient of many quantitative models. Such models require\nthat all traits are fixed when specifying the \"initial cultural state\".\nTypically, this initial state is randomly generated, from a uniform\ndistribution over the set of possible combinations of traits. However, recent\nwork has shown that the outcome of social influence dynamics strongly depends\non the nature of the initial state. If the latter is sampled from empirical\ndata instead of being generated in a uniformly random way, a higher level of\ncultural diversity is found after long-term dynamics, for the same level of\npropensity towards collective behavior in the short-term. Moreover, if the\ninitial state is randomized by shuffling the empirical traits among people, the\nlevel of long-term cultural diversity is in-between those obtained for the\nempirical and uniformly random counterparts. The current study repeats the\nanalysis for multiple empirical data sets, showing that the results are\nremarkably similar, although the matrix of correlations between cultural\nvariables clearly differs across data sets. This points towards robust\nstructural properties inherent in empirical cultural states, possibly due to\nuniversal laws governing the dynamics of culture in the real world. The results\nalso suggest that this dynamics might be characterized by criticality and\ninvolve mechanisms beyond social influence.

A transition between different\nsearching strategies for navigating in metropolitan maps has been observed for\nlarge, complex metropolitan networks. This evidence suggests the existence of\nanother limit associated to the cognitive overload and caused by large amounts\nof information to process. In this light, we analyzed the world's 15 largest\nmetropolitan networks and estimated the information limit for determining a\ntrip in a transportation system to be on the order of 8 bits. Similar to the\n\"Dunbar number,\" which represents a limit to the size of an individual's\nfriendship circle, our cognitive limit suggests that maps should not consist of\nmore than about $250$ connections points to be easily readable. We also show\nthat including connections with other transportation modes dramatically\nincreases the information needed to navigate in multilayer transportation\nnetworks: in large cities such as New York, Paris, and Tokyo, more than $80\\%$\nof trips are above the 8-bit limit. Multimodal transportation systems in large\ncities have thus already exceeded human cognitive limits and consequently the\ntraditional view of navigation in cities has to be revised substantially.

It is known that the classical capacity of quantum channels can be\nenhanced by such entangled encoding schemes, but this is not always the case.\nIn this paper, we prove that a strong converse theorem holds for the classical\ncapacity of an entanglement-breaking channel even when it is assisted by a\nclassical feedback link from the receiver to the transmitter. In doing so, we\nidentify a bound on the strong converse exponent, which determines the\nexponentially decaying rate at which the success probability tends to zero, for\na sequence of codes with communication rate exceeding capacity. Proving a\nstrong converse, along with an achievability theorem, shows that the classical\ncapacity is a sharp boundary between reliable and unreliable communication\nregimes. One of the main tools in our proof is the sandwiched Renyi relative\nentropy. The same method of proof is used to derive an exponential bound on the\nsuccess probability when communicating over an arbitrary quantum channel\nassisted by classical feedback, provided that the transmitter does not use\nentangled encoding schemes.

Using this framework,\nwe introduce a special case, called \"Lumberjack\", using very sparse random\nprojections, that is, linear combinations of a small subset of features.\nLumberjack obtains statistically significantly improved accuracy over Random\nForests, Gradient Boosted Trees, and other approaches on a standard benchmark\nsuites for classification with varying dimension, sample size, and number of\nclasses. To illustrate how, why, and when Lumberjack outperforms other methods,\nwe conduct extensive simulated experiments, in vectors, images, and nonlinear\nmanifolds. Lumberjack typically yields improved performance over existing\ndecision trees ensembles, while mitigating computational efficiency and\nscalability, and maintaining interpretability. Lumberjack can easily be\nincorporated into other ensemble methods such as boosting to obtain potentially\nsimilar gains.

Our objective is to add a certain number of edges to an undirected\nnetwork, with a known graph Laplacian, in order to optimally enhance\nclosed-loop performance. To promote controller sparsity, we introduce\n$\\ell_1$-regularization into the optimal ${\\cal H}_2$ formulation and cast the\ndesign problem as a semidefinite program. We derive a Lagrange dual, provide\ninterpretation of dual variables, and exploit structure of the optimality\nconditions for undirected networks to develop customized proximal gradient and\nNewton algorithms that are well-suited for large problems. We illustrate that\nour algorithms can solve the problems with more than million edges in the\ncontroller graph in a few minutes, on a PC. We also exploit structure of\nconnected resistive networks to demonstrate how additional edges can be\nsystematically added in order to minimize the ${\\cal H}_2$ norm of the\nclosed-loop system.

Such conditions occur in many real-world\nscenarios, and compressed sensing has emerging applications in medical imaging,\nbig data, and statistics. Finding practical matrix constructions and\ncomputationally efficient recovery algorithms for compressed sensing is an area\nof intense research interest. Many probabilistic matrix constructions have been\nproposed, and it is now well known that matrices with entries drawn from a\nsuitable probability distribution are essentially optimal for compressed\nsensing.\n  Potential applications have motivated the search for constructions of sparse\ncompressed sensing matrices (i.e., matrices containing few non-zero entries).\nVarious constructions have been proposed, and simulations suggest that their\nperformance is comparable to that of dense matrices. In this paper, extensive\nsimulations are presented which suggest that sparsification leads to a marked\nimprovement in compressed sensing performance for a large class of matrix\nconstructions and for many different recovery algorithms.

From the start, strong isolation between cloud tenants was seen\nto be of paramount importance, provided first by virtual machines (VM) and\nlater by containers, which share the operating system (OS) kernel. Increasingly\nit is the case that applications also require facilities to effect isolation\nand protection of data managed by those applications. They also require\nflexible data sharing with other applications, often across the traditional\ncloud-isolation boundaries; for example, when government provides many related\nservices for its citizens on a common platform. Similar considerations apply to\nthe end-users of applications. But in particular, the incorporation of cloud\nservices within `Internet of Things' architectures is driving the requirements\nfor both protection and cross-application data sharing.\n  These concerns relate to the management of data. Traditional access control\nis application and principal/role specific, applied at policy enforcement\npoints, after which there is no subsequent control over where data flows; a\ncrucial issue once data has left its owner's control by cloud-hosted\napplications and within cloud-services. Information Flow Control (IFC), in\naddition, offers system-wide, end-to-end, flow control based on the properties\nof the data. We discuss the potential of cloud-deployed IFC for enforcing\nowners' dataflow policy with regard to protection and sharing, as well as\nsafeguarding against malicious or buggy software. In addition, the audit log\nassociated with IFC provides transparency, giving configurable system-wide\nvisibility over data flows.

The stationary points are obtained by solving\na sequence of successively refined approximate problems, each of which is much\neasier to solve than the original problem. To achieve convergence, the\napproximate problem only needs to exhibit a weak form of convexity, namely,\npseudo-convexity. We show that the proposed framework not only includes as\nspecial cases a number of existing methods, for example, the gradient method\nand the Jacobi algorithm, but also leads to new algorithms which enjoy easier\nimplementation and faster convergence speed. We also propose a novel line\nsearch method for nondifferentiable optimization problems, which is carried out\nover a properly constructed differentiable function with the benefit of a\nsimplified implementation as compared to state-of-the-art line search\ntechniques that directly operate on the original nondifferentiable objective\nfunction. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are shown, both\ntheoretically and numerically, by several example applications, namely, MIMO\nbroadcast channel capacity computation, energy efficiency maximization in\nmassive MIMO systems and LASSO in sparse signal recovery.

For polar codes, the selection is based on the Bhattacharyya parameter\nof the row, which is closely related to the error probability of the\ncorresponding input bit under sequential decoding. For Reed-Muller codes, the\nselection is based on the Hamming weight of the row. This work investigates the\nproperties of the index sets pointing to those rows in the infinite blocklength\nlimit. In particular, the Lebesgue measure, the Hausdorff dimension, and the\nself-similarity of these sets will be discussed. It is shown that these index\nsets have several properties that are common to fractals.

The success of this approach depends on the accuracy of the\nestimate of the predictive complexity. In the large-sample-size limit of a\nregular model, the predictive performance is well estimated by the Akaike\nInformation Criterion (AIC). However, this approximation can either\nsignificantly under or over-estimating the complexity in a wide range of\nimportant applications where models are either non-regular or\nfinite-sample-size corrections are significant. We introduce an improved\napproximation for the complexity that is used to define a new information\ncriterion: the Frequentist Information Criterion (QIC). QIC extends the\napplicability of information-based inference to the finite-sample-size regime\nof regular models and to singular models. We demonstrate the power and the\ncomparative advantage of QIC in a number of example analyses.

A novel method is proposed to reduce the\npeak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR), which is commonly used to evaluate\nthe fluctuation. The proposed method is based on the tone reservation approach,\nin which some bits or subcarriers of OFDM are allocated for decreasing PMEPR.\nWe introduce the coefficient of variation of envelopes (CVE) as the cost\nfunction for waveform optimization, and develop an iterative least squares\nalgorithm. Minimizing CVE leads to distinct PMEPR reduction, and it is\nguaranteed that the cost function monotonically decreases by applying the\niterative algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that the envelope is significantly\nsmoothed by the proposed method.

An\norganism needs to track fitness-relevant information about its world, but the\nmore information it tracks, the more resources it must devote to memory and\nprocessing. Rate-distortion theory shows that, when errors are allowed,\nremarkably efficient internal representations can be found by\nbiologically-plausible hill-climbing mechanisms. We identify two regimes: a\nhigh-fidelity regime where perceptual costs scale logarithmically with\nenvironmental complexity, and a low-fidelity regime where perceptual costs are,\nremarkably, independent of the environment. When environmental complexity is\nrising, Darwinian evolution should drive organisms to the threshold between the\nhigh- and low-fidelity regimes. Organisms that code efficiently will find\nthemselves able to make, just barely, the most subtle distinctions in their\nenvironment.

Many of these\nattacks appear to be `lone wolf' ones driven by specific individual\nmotivations, and the identification of precursor signals and hence actionable\npolicy measures would thus seem highly unlikely. Here, we take a system-wide\nview and investigate the timing of school attacks and the dynamical feedback\nwith social media. We identify a trend divergence in which college attacks have\ncontinued to accelerate over the last 25 years while those carried out on K-12\nschools have slowed down. We establish the copycat effect in school shootings\nand uncover a statistical association between social media chatter and the\nprobability of an attack in the following days.

The study of which properties\nare elicitable sheds light on the capabilities and limits of empirical risk\nminimization. While several recent papers have asked which properties are\nelicitable, we instead advocate for a more nuanced question: how many\ndimensions are required to indirectly elicit a given property? This number is\ncalled the elicitation complexity of the property. We lay the foundation for a\ngeneral theory of elicitation complexity, including several basic results about\nhow elicitation complexity behaves, and the complexity of standard properties\nof interest. Building on this foundation, we establish several upper and lower\nbounds for the broad class of Bayes risks. We apply these results by proving\ntight complexity bounds, with respect to identifiable properties, for variance,\nfinancial risk measures, entropy, norms, and new properties of interest. We\nthen show how some of these bounds can extend to other practical classes of\nproperties, and conclude with a discussion of open directions.

Here a\nmodel is presented that examines the interest rate required to succeed as an\ninvestor in a zero-sum fixed quantity hard-money system. Even when the playing\nfield is significantly tilted toward the investor, interest rates need to be\nmuch higher than expected. In a completely fair zero-sum system, an investor\ncannot break even without charging 100% interest. Even with a 5% advantage, an\ninvestor won't break even at 15% interest. From this it is concluded that what\nwe consider usurious rates today are, within a hard-money system, driven by\nnecessity.\n  Cryptocurrency is a novel form of hard-currency. The inability to virtualize\nthe money creates a system close to zero-sum because of the limited supply\ndesign. Therefore, within the bounds of a cryptocurrency system that limits\nmoney creation, interest rates must rise to levels that the modern world\nconsiders usury. It is impossible, therefore, that a cryptocurrency that is not\nexpandable could take over a modern economy and replace modern fiat currency.

The number of non-overlapping seeds a mapper selects determines the\nsensitivity of the mapper while the total frequency of all selected seeds\ndetermines the speed of the mapper. Modern seed-and-extend mappers usually\nselect seeds with either an equal and fixed-length scheme or with an inflexible\nplacement scheme, both of which limit the potential of the mapper to select\nless frequent seeds to speed up the mapping process. Therefore, it is crucial\nto develop a new algorithm that can adjust both the individual seed length and\nthe seed placement, as well as derive less frequent seeds.\n  Results: We present the Optimal Seed Solver (OSS), a dynamic programming\nalgorithm that discovers the least frequently-occurring set of x seeds in an\nL-bp read in $O(x \\times L)$ operations on average and in $O(x \\times L^{2})$\noperations in the worst case. We compared OSS against four state-of-the-art\nseed selection schemes and observed that OSS provides a 3-fold reduction of\naverage seed frequency over the best previous seed selection optimizations.

This allows us to exploit\nhighly-tuned computer algebra systems like Mathematica to guide our procedure\nwithout impacting the correctness of its results.

The minimization of the matrix rank coupled with the\nFrobenius norm data fidelity can be solved by the hard thresholding filter with\nprinciple component analysis (PCA) or singular value decomposition (SVD). Based\non this idea, we propose a patch-based low-rank minimization method for image\ndenoising. The main denoising process is stated in three equivalent way: PCA,\nSVD and low-rank minimization. Compared to recent patch-based sparse\nrepresentation methods, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is\nrather rapid, and it is effective for a variety of natural grayscale images and\ncolor images, especially for texture parts in images. Further improvements of\nthis method are also given. In addition, due to the simplicity of this method,\nwe could provide an explanation of the choice of the threshold parameter,\nestimation of PSNR values, and give other insights into this method.

In this paper we review techniques exploiting the graph structure\nfor exact inference, borrowed from optimisation and computer science. They are\nbuilt on the principle of variable elimination whose complexity is dictated in\nan intricate way by the order in which variables are eliminated. The so-called\ntreewidth of the graph characterises this algorithmic complexity: low-treewidth\ngraphs can be processed efficiently. The first message that we illustrate is\ntherefore the idea that for inference in graphical model, the number of\nvariables is not the limiting factor, and it is worth checking for the\ntreewidth before turning to approximate methods. We show how algorithms\nproviding an upper bound of the treewidth can be exploited to derive a 'good'\nelimination order enabling to perform exact inference. The second message is\nthat when the treewidth is too large, algorithms for approximate inference\nlinked to the principle of variable elimination, such as loopy belief\npropagation and variational approaches, can lead to accurate results while\nbeing much less time consuming than Monte-Carlo approaches. We illustrate the\ntechniques reviewed in this article on benchmarks of inference problems in\ngenetic linkage analysis and computer vision, as well as on hidden variables\nrestoration in coupled Hidden Markov Models.

It extends\nthe Moser-Tardos resampling algorithm [17] to more general discrete spaces. At\neach step the method picks a flaw present in the current state and goes to a\nnew state according to some prespecified probability distribution (which\ndepends on the current state and the selected flaw). However, it is less\nflexible than the Moser-Tardos method since [10,2,3] require a specific flaw\nselection rule, whereas [17] allows an arbitrary rule (and thus can potentially\nbe implemented more efficiently).\n  We formulate a new \"commutativity\" condition, and prove that it is sufficient\nfor an arbitrary rule to work. It also enables an efficient parallelization\nunder an additional assumption. We then show that existing resampling oracles\nfor perfect matchings and permutations do satisfy this condition.

In addition, relaxing the motion\nconstraints and solving the resulting Euclidean TSP (ETSP) provides the only\nlower bound available for the problem. However, in many problem instances, the\nlower bound computed by solving the ETSP is far below the cost of the feasible\nsolutions obtained by some well-known algorithms for the DTSP.

A number of such\nalgorithms is given. These algorithms are compared using the Goodman-Kruskal\ncorrelation coefficient. As a global criterion it is an internal\ngoodness-of-fit measure based on the set order induced by the hierarchy\ncompared to the order associated to the given dissimilarities. Applied to a\nhundred of random data tables, these comparisons are in favor of two methods\nbased on unusual ratio-type formulas for the splitting procedures, namely the\nSilhouette criterion and Dunn's criterion. These two criteria take into account\nboth the within cluster and the between cluster mean dissimilarity. In general\nthe results of these two algorithms are better than the classical Agglomerative\nAverage Link method.

Kernel-based nonparametric statistics have\nbeen used for this task which enjoy fewer assumptions on the distributions than\nthe parametric approach and can handle high-dimensional data. In this paper we\nfocus on the scenario when the amount of background data is large, and propose\ntwo related computationally efficient kernel-based statistics for change-point\ndetection, which are inspired by the recently developed $B$-statistics. A novel\ntheoretical result of the paper is the characterization of the tail probability\nof these statistics using the change-of-measure technique, which focuses on\ncharacterizing the tail of the detection statistics rather than obtaining its\nasymptotic distribution under the null distribution. Such approximations are\ncrucial to control the false alarm rate, which corresponds to the significance\nlevel in offline change-point detection and the average-run-length in online\nchange-point detection. Our approximations are shown to be highly accurate.\nThus, they provide a convenient way to find detection thresholds for both\noffline and online cases without the need to resort to the more expensive\nsimulations or bootstrapping. We show that our methods perform well on both\nsynthetic data and real data. Comment: Submitted for journal publication.

In recent years, some itemset\nrepresentations based on node sets have been proposed, which have shown to be\nvery efficient for mining frequent itemsets. In this paper, we propose\nDiffNodeset, a novel and more efficient itemset representation, for mining\nfrequent itemsets. Based on the DiffNodeset structure, we present an efficient\nalgorithm, named dFIN, to mining frequent itemsets. To achieve high efficiency,\ndFIN finds frequent itemsets using a set-enumeration tree with a hybrid search\nstrategy and directly enumerates frequent itemsets without candidate generation\nunder some case. For evaluating the performance of dFIN, we have conduct\nextensive experiments to compare it against with existing leading algorithms on\na variety of real and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that\ndFIN is significantly faster than these leading algorithms.

We propose a region-based semantic segmentation framework which\nhandles both full and weak supervision, and addresses three common problems:\n(1) Objects occur at multiple scales and therefore we should use regions at\nmultiple scales. However, these regions are overlapping which creates\nconflicting class predictions at the pixel-level. (2) Class frequencies are\nhighly imbalanced in realistic datasets. (3) Each pixel can only be assigned to\na single class, which creates competition between classes. We address all three\nproblems with a joint calibration method which optimizes a multi-class loss\ndefined over the final pixel-level output labeling, as opposed to simply region\nclassification. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on the popular SIFT\nFlow [18] dataset in both the fully and weakly supervised setting by a\nconsiderably margin (+6% and +10%, respectively).

A fundamental issue\nis how to identify key nodes, for which purpose a number of centrality measures\nhave been developed. This paper proposes a new parametric family of centrality\nmeasures called generalized degree. It is based on the idea that a relationship\nto a more interconnected node contributes to centrality in a greater extent\nthan a connection to a less central one. Generalized degree improves on degree\nby redistributing its sum over the network with the consideration of the global\nstructure. Application of the measure is supported by a set of basic\nproperties. A sufficient condition is given for generalized degree to be rank\nmonotonic, excluding counter-intuitive changes in the centrality ranking after\ncertain modifications of the network. The measure has a graph interpretation\nand can be calculated iteratively. Generalized degree is recommended to apply\nbesides degree since it preserves most favourable attributes of degree, but\nbetter reflects the role of the nodes in the network and has an increased\nability to distinguish among their importance.

When\nrestricted to 1-dimensional subspaces, this problem is equivalent to computing\nthe trellis-width (or minimum trellis state-complexity) of a linear code in\ncoding theory and computing the path-width of an $\\mathbb F$-represented\nmatroid in matroid theory.\n  We present a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to construct a linear layout\nof width at most k, if it exists, for input subspaces of a finite-dimensional\nvector space over $\\mathbb F$. As corollaries, we obtain a fixed-parameter\ntractable algorithm to produce a path-decomposition of width at most k for an\ninput $\\mathbb F$-represented matroid of path-width at most k, and a\nfixed-parameter tractable algorithm to find a linear rank-decomposition of\nwidth at most k for an input graph of linear rank-width at most k. In both\ncorollaries, no such algorithms were known previously.\n  It was previously known that a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm exists for\nthe decision version of the problem for matroid path-width, a theorem by\nGeelen, Gerards, and Whittle~(2002) implies that for each fixed finite field\n$\\mathbb F$, there are finitely many forbidden $\\mathbb F$-representable minors\nfor the class of matroids of path-width at most k.

To produce accurate\nstatistics about the habits of a population of users of a system, this data\nmight need to be processed through model-based estimators. Moreover, models of\npopulation dynamics, originating for example from epidemiology or the social\nsciences, are often necessarily nonlinear. Motivated by these trends, this\npaper presents an approach to design nonlinear privacy-preserving model-based\nobservers, relying on additive input or output noise to give differential\nprivacy guarantees to the individuals providing the input data. For the case of\noutput perturbation, contraction analysis allows us to design convergent\nobservers as well as set the level of privacy-preserving noise appropriately.\nTwo examples illustrate the approach: estimating the edge formation\nprobabilities in a dynamic social network, and syndromic surveillance relying\non an epidemiological model.

The receiver\nincorporates sparsity-based parametric channel estimation. State-of-the-art\nsparsity-based iterative receivers simplify the channel estimation problem by\nrestricting the multipath delays to a grid. Our receiver does not impose such a\nrestriction. As a result it does not suffer from the leakage effect, which\ndestroys sparsity. Communication at near capacity rates in high SNR requires a\nlarge modulation order. Due to the close proximity of modulation symbols in\nsuch systems, the grid-based approximation is of insufficient accuracy. We show\nnumerically that a state-of-the-art iterative receiver with grid-based sparse\nchannel estimation exhibits a bit-error-rate floor in the high SNR regime. On\nthe contrary, our receiver performs very close to the perfect channel state\ninformation bound for all SNR values. We also demonstrate both theoretically\nand numerically that parametric channel estimation works well in dense\nchannels, i.e., when the number of multipath components is large and each\nindividual component cannot be resolved.

To accomplish this we split the class of CA graphs into uniform and\nnon-uniform ones and employ a generalized version of the argument given by\nK\\\"obler et al (2013) that has been used to show that the subclass of Helly CA\ngraphs can be canonized in logspace. For uniform CA graphs our approach works\nin logspace and in addition to that Helly CA graphs are a strict subset of\nuniform CA graphs. Thus our result is a generalization of the canonization\nresult for Helly CA graphs. In the non-uniform case a specific set of ambiguous\nvertices arises. By choosing the parameter to be the cardinality of this set\nthe obstacle can be solved by brute force. This leads to an O(k + log n) space\nalgorithm to compute a canonical representation for non-uniform and therefore\nall CA graphs.

A triangulation for $S$ is a maximal plane\nstraight-line graph with vertex set $S$. The Voronoi diagram for $S$ is the\nsubdivision of the plane into cells such that all points in a cell have the\nsame nearest neighbor in $S$. Classically, both structures can be computed in\n$O(n \\log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space. We study the situation when the available\nworkspace is limited: given a parameter $s \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, an\n$s$-workspace algorithm has read-only access to an input array with the points\nfrom $S$ in arbitrary order, and it may use only $O(s)$ additional words of\n$\\Theta(\\log n)$ bits for reading and writing intermediate data. The output\nshould then be written to a write-only structure. We describe a deterministic\n$s$-workspace algorithm for computing an arbitrary triangulation of $S$ in time\n$O(n^2/s + n \\log n \\log s )$ and a randomized $s$-workspace algorithm for\nfinding the Voronoi diagram of $S$ in expected time $O((n^2/s) \\log s + n \\log\ns \\log^*s)$.

Multiple variants of a malware may spread at\ndifferent rates and have different levels of visibility to the network. In this\nwork we examine the optimal strategies for the attacker so as to trade off the\nextent of spread of the malware against the need for stealth. We show that in\nthe mean-field deterministic regime, this spread-stealth trade-off is optimized\nby computationally simple single-threshold policies. Specifically, we show that\nonly one variant of the malware is spread by the attacker at each time, as\nthere exists a time up to which the attacker prioritizes maximizing the spread\nof the malware, and after which she prioritizes stealth.

Under this new method, it has been shown that the\nrequired power budget becomes independent of the number of served terminals in\nthe downlink. However, the required power depends only of the coverage area,\ni.e. the channel losses at the cell boarder. Therefore, huge number\n(theoretically any number) of terminals could be supported concurrently at\nfinite and small downlink power budget. This could be very useful to support\nthe downlink signalling channels in HSPA+, LTE, and 5G. It can be very useful\nalso to support huge D2D communication downlinks. Moreover, and based on the\nsame concept, a new system configuration for a single link point-to-point\ncommunication has been presented. With this new configuration, the achieved\ndata rate becomes independent of the required transmit power. This means that\nany data rate can be achieved at the target BER and with small and finite\ntransmit power. This seems violating with some major results of the Shannon\ntheorem. This issue will be discussed in details in this article.

Several\noverlapping extensions of modularity were proposed to measure the quality of\noverlapping community structure. However, all these extensions differ just in\nthe way they define the belonging coefficient and belonging function. Yet,\nthere is lack of systematic comparison of different extensions. To fill this\ngap, we overview overlapping extensions of modularity and generalize them with\na uniform definition enabling application of different belonging coefficients\nand belonging functions to select the best. In addition, we extend localized\nmodularity, modularity density, and eight local community quality metrics to\nenable their usages for overlapping communities. The experimental results on a\nlarge number of real networks and synthetic networks using overlapping\nextensions of modularity, overlapping modularity density, and local metrics\nshow that the best results are obtained when the product of the belonging\ncoefficients of two nodes is used as the belonging function. Moreover, the\nresults may be used to guide researchers on which metrics to adopt when\nmeasuring the quality of overlapping community structure.

Although several\noverlapping extensions of modularity were proposed to measure the quality of\noverlapping community structure, there is lack of systematic comparison of\ndifferent extensions. To fill this gap, we overview overlapping extensions of\nmodularity to select the best. In addition, we extend the Modularity Density\nmetric to enable its usage for overlapping communities. The experimental\nresults on four real networks using overlapping extensions of modularity,\noverlapping modularity density, and six other community quality metrics show\nthat the best results are obtained when the product of the belonging\ncoefficients of two nodes is used as the belonging function. Moreover, our\nexperiments indicate that overlapping modularity density is a better measure of\nthe quality of overlapping community structure than other metrics considered.

Detecting and\ncharacterizing such community structure, which is known as community detection,\nis one of the fundamental issues in the study of network systems. It has\nreceived a considerable attention in the last years. Numerous techniques have\nbeen developed for both efficient and effective community detection. Among\nthem, the most efficient algorithm is the label propagation algorithm whose\ncomputational complexity is O(|E|). Although it is linear in the number of\nedges, the running time is still too long for very large networks, creating the\nneed for parallel community detection. Also, computing community quality\nmetrics for community structure is computationally expensive both with and\nwithout ground truth. However, to date we are not aware of any effort to\nintroduce parallelism for this problem. In this paper, we provide a parallel\ntoolkit to calculate the values of such metrics. We evaluate the parallel\nalgorithms on both distributed memory machine and shared memory machine. The\nexperimental results show that they yield a significant performance gain over\nsequential execution in terms of total running time, speedup, and efficiency.

The presented approach identifies contiguous\nanomalous periods, rather than daily spikes or drops, and allows anomalies to\nbe ranked according to deviation from expected behaviour.\n  The developed method is implemented as a running tool, with outputs published\ndaily by mailing list. This list highlights per-country anomalous Tor usage,\nand produces a daily ranking of countries according to the level of detected\nanomalous behaviour. This list has been active since August 2016, and is in use\nby a number of individuals, academics, and NGOs as an early warning system for\npotential censorship events.\n  We focus on Tor, however the presented approach is more generally applicable\nto usage data of other services, both individually and in combination. We\ndemonstrate that combining multiple data sources allows more specific\nidentification of likely Tor blocking events.

The granularity of the GPS\ndata necessary for this analysis is relatively coarse; it only requires\ncoordinates for the beginning and end of trips, the metered distance, and the\ntotal travel time. The method works by computing the historical distribution of\npace (normalized travel times) between various regions of a city and measuring\nthe pace deviations during an unusual event. This method is applied to a\ndataset of nearly 700 million taxi trips in New York City, which is used to\nanalyze the transportation infrastructure resilience to Hurricane Sandy. The\nanalysis indicates that Hurricane Sandy impacted traffic conditions for more\nthan five days, and caused a peak delay of two minutes per mile. Practically,\nit identifies that the evacuation caused only minor disruptions, but\nsignificant delays were encountered during the post-disaster reentry process.\nSince the implementation of this method is very efficient, it could potentially\nbe used as an online monitoring tool, representing a first step toward\nquantifying city scale resilience with coarse GPS data.

Moreover, symmetry of faces holds in both\nstructures as well as in the so-called affine oriented matroids. These two\nfundamental properties (formulated for covectors) together lead to the natural\nnotion of \"conditional oriented matroid\" (abbreviated COM). These novel\nstructures can be characterized in terms of three cocircuits axioms,\ngeneralizing the familiar characterization for oriented matroids. We describe a\nbinary composition scheme by which every COM can successively be erected as a\ncertain complex of oriented matroids, in essentially the same way as a lopsided\nset can be glued together from its maximal hypercube faces. A realizable COM is\nrepresented by a hyperplane arrangement restricted to an open convex set. Among\nthese are the examples formed by linear extensions of ordered sets,\ngeneralizing the oriented matroids corresponding to the permutohedra. Relaxing\nrealizability to local realizability, we capture a wider class of combinatorial\nobjects: we show that non-positively curved Coxeter zonotopal complexes give\nrise to locally realizable COMs. Comment: 40 pages, 6 figures, (improved exposition)", "1507.06576": "Abstract Gringo,T h i s   p a p e r   d e f i n e s   t h e   s y n t a x   a n d   s e m a n t i c s   o f   t h e   i n p u t   l a n g u a g e   o f   t h e   A S P \n g r o u n d e r   G R I N G O .

In this work, an achievable scheme\nfor the wiretap channel with generalized feedback is presented. This scheme,\nwhich uses the feedback signal to generate a shared secret key between the\nlegitimate users, encrypts the message to be sent at the bit level. New\ncapacity results for a class of channels are provided, as well as some new\ninsights into the secret key agreement problem. Moreover, this scheme recovers\npreviously reported rate regions from the literature, and thus it can be seen\nas a generalization that unifies several results in the field.

If $\\#\\mathcal{C}= q^{n(m-d+1)}$, then\n$\\mathcal{C}$ is a maximum rank distance (MRD for short) code. Until 2016,\nthere were only two known constructions of MRD codes for arbitrary $1<d<m-1$.\nOne was found by Delsarte (1978) and Gabidulin (1985) independently, and it was\nlater generalized by Kshevetskiy and Gabidulin (2005). We often call them\n(generalized) Gabidulin codes. Another family was recently obtained by Sheekey\n(2016), and its elements are called twisted Gabidulin codes. In the same paper,\nSheekey also proposed a generalization of the twisted Gabidulin codes. However\nthe equivalence problem for it is not considered, whence it is not clear\nwhether there exist new MRD codes in this generalization. We call the members\nof this putative larger family generalized twisted Gabidulin codes. In this\npaper, we first compute the Delsarte duals and adjoint codes of them, then we\ncompletely determine the equivalence between different generalized twisted\nGabidulin codes. In particular, it can be proven that, up to equivalence,\ngeneralized Gabidulin codes and twisted Gabidulin codes are both proper subsets\nof this family.

At query time, it is possible to\ncapture multiple views of an object from different viewing angles and at\ndifferent scales with the mobile device camera to obtain richer information\nabout the object compared to a single view and hence return more accurate\nresults. Motivated by this, we developed a mobile multi-view object image\nsearch system, using a client-server architecture. Multi-view images of objects\nacquired by the mobile clients are processed and local features are sent to the\nserver, which combines the query image representations with early/late fusion\nmethods based on bag-of-visual-words and sends back the query results. We\nperformed a comprehensive analysis of early and late fusion approaches using\nvarious similarity functions, on an existing single view and a new multi-view\nobject image database. The experimental results show that multi-view search\nprovides significantly better retrieval accuracy compared to single view\nsearch. Comment: Multimedia Tools and Applications, 2017", "1508.00217": "Indexing of CNN Features for Large Scale Image Search,The convolutional neural network (CNN) features can give a good description\nof image content, which usually represent images with unique global vectors.\nAlthough they are compact compared to local descriptors, they still cannot\nefficiently deal with large-scale image retrieval due to the cost of the linear\nincremental computation and storage. To address this issue, we build a simple\nbut effective indexing framework based on inverted table, which significantly\ndecreases both the search time and memory usage. In addition, several\nstrategies are fully investigated under an indexing framework to adapt it to\nCNN features and compensate for quantization errors. First, we use multiple\nassignment for the query and database images to increase the probability of\nrelevant images' co-existing in the same Voronoi cells obtained via the\nclustering algorithm. Then, we introduce embedding codes to further improve\nprecision by removing false matches during a search. We demonstrate that by\nusing hashing schemes to calculate the embedding codes and by changing the\nranking rule, indexing framework speeds can be greatly improved. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on several unsupervised and supervised benchmarks support\nthese results and the superiority of the proposed indexing framework. We also\nprovide a fair comparison between the popular CNN features.

Two important examples that motivate this work are optimization\nproblems from phase retrieval and from blind deconvolution, which are designed\nto yield rank-1 solutions. An algorithm is described that is based on solving a\ncertain constrained eigenvalue optimization problem that corresponds to the\ngauge dual which, unlike the more typical Lagrange dual, has an especially\nsimple constraint. The dominant cost at each iteration is the computation of\nrightmost eigenpairs of a Hermitian operator. A range of numerical examples\nillustrate the scalability of the approach.

In natural\nlanguage processing, recent work \\cite{Zhang14,Zhang15} has proposed the use of\nthe maximum loss over random structured outputs sampled independently from some\nproposal distribution. This method is linear-time in the number of random\nstructured outputs and trivially parallelizable. We study this family of loss\nfunctions in the PAC-Bayes framework under Gaussian perturbations\n\\cite{McAllester07}. Under some technical conditions and up to statistical\naccuracy, we show that this family of loss functions produces a tighter upper\nbound of the Gibbs decoder distortion than commonly used methods. Thus, using\nthe maximum loss over random structured outputs is a principled way of learning\nthe parameter of structured prediction models. Besides explaining the\nexperimental success of \\cite{Zhang14,Zhang15}, our theoretical results show\nthat more general techniques are possible.

As a result, simple models of\ntopological contagion do not accurately represent the propagation of cascades\nin power systems. However, cascading power outages do follow patterns, some of\nwhich are useful in understanding and reducing blackout risk. This paper\ndescribes a method by which the data from many cascading failure simulations\ncan be transformed into a graph-based model of influences that provides\nactionable information about the many ways that cascades propagate in a\nparticular system. The resulting \"influence graph\" model is Markovian, in that\ncomponent outage probabilities depend only on the outages that occurred in the\nprior generation. To validate the model we compare the distribution of cascade\nsizes resulting from $n-2$ contingencies in a $2896$ branch test case to\ncascade sizes in the influence graph. The two distributions are remarkably\nsimilar. In addition, we derive an equation with which one can quickly identify\nmodifications to the proposed system that will substantially reduce cascade\npropagation. With this equation one can quickly identify critical components\nthat can be improved to substantially reduce the risk of large cascading\nblackouts.

In practice, both\nattackers and defenders have resource constraints that could limit their\ncapabilities. Hence, to develop robust defense strategies, a promising approach\nis to utilize game theory to understand the fundamental trade-offs involved.\nPrevious works in this direction, however, mainly focus on the single-node case\nwithout considering strict resource constraints. In this paper, a\ngame-theoretic model for protecting a system of multiple nodes against stealthy\nattacks is proposed. We consider the practical setting where the frequencies of\nboth attack and defense are constrained by limited resources, and an asymmetric\nfeedback structure where the attacker can fully observe the states of nodes\nwhile largely hiding its actions from the defender. We characterize the best\nresponse strategies for both attacker and defender in the space of both\nnon-adaptive and adaptive strategies, and study the Nash Equilibria of the\ngame.

An FH sequence\nspecifies the frequency channel to be used as communication progresses. Much of\nthe research on the performance of FH schemes is based on either pairwise\nmutual interference or adversarial interference but not both. In this paper, we\nevaluate the performance of an FH scheme with respect to both group-wise mutual\ninterference and adversarial interference (jamming), bearing in mind that more\nthan two users may be transmitting simultaneously in the presence of a jammer.\nWe establish a correspondence between a cover-free code and an FH scheme. This\ngives a lower bound on the transmission capacity. Furthermore, we specify a\njammer model and consider what additional properties a cover-free code should\nhave to resist the jammer. We demonstrate that a purely combinatorial approach\nis inadequate against such a jammer, but that with the use of pseudorandomness,\nwe can have a system that has high throughput as well as security against\njamming.

In the proposed scheme, referred to as the analog fountain compressive\nsensing (AFCS), each measurement is generated from a linear combination of L\nrandomly selected binary signal elements with real weight coefficients. The\nweight coefficients are chosen from a finite weight set and L, called\nmeasurement degree, is obtained based on a predefined degree distribution\nfunction. We propose a simple verification based reconstruction algorithm for\nthe AFCS in the noiseless case. The proposed verification based decoder is\nanalyzed through SUM-OR tree analytical approach and an optimization problem is\nformulated to find the optimum measurement degree to minimize the number of\nmeasurements required for the reconstruction of binary sparse signals. We show\nthat in the AFCS, the number of required measurements is of O(-n log(1-k/n)),\nwhere n is the signal length and k is the signal sparsity level. We then\nconsider the signal reconstruction of AFCS in the presence of additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN) and the standard message passing decoder is then used for\nthe signal recovery. Simulation results show that the AFCS can perfectly\nrecover all non-zero elements of the sparse binary signal with a significantly\nreduced number of measurements, compared to the conventional binary CS and\nL1-minimization approaches in a wide range of signal to noise ratios (SNRs).\nFinally, we show a practical application of the AFCS for the sparse event\ndetection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where the sensors' readings can\nbe treated as measurements from the CS point of view.

An action language is\nextended to support non-boolean fluents and non-deterministic causal laws. This\naction language is used to describe tightly-coupled transition diagrams at two\nlevels of granularity, with a fine-resolution transition diagram defined as a\nrefinement of a coarse-resolution transition diagram of the domain. The\ncoarse-resolution system description, and a history that includes (prioritized)\ndefaults, are translated into an Answer Set Prolog (ASP) program. For any given\ngoal, inference in the ASP program provides a plan of abstract actions. To\nimplement each such abstract action, the robot automatically zooms to the part\nof the fine-resolution transition diagram relevant to this action. A\nprobabilistic representation of the uncertainty in sensing and actuation is\nthen included in this zoomed fine-resolution system description, and used to\nconstruct a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The policy\nobtained by solving the POMDP is invoked repeatedly to implement the abstract\naction as a sequence of concrete actions, with the corresponding observations\nbeing recorded in the coarse-resolution history and used for subsequent\nreasoning. The architecture is evaluated in simulation and on a mobile robot\nmoving objects in an indoor domain, to show that it supports reasoning with\nviolation of defaults, noisy observations and unreliable actions, in complex\ndomains.

This was first studied in the pioneering work of Shannon who\nestablished a simple expression characterizing this quantity in the limit of\nmultiple independent uses of the channel. Here we consider the general setting\nwith only one use of the channel. We observe that the maximum success\nprobability can be expressed as the maximum value of a submodular function.\nUsing this connection, we establish the following results:\n  1. There is a simple greedy polynomial-time algorithm that computes a code\nachieving a (1-1/e)-approximation of the maximum success probability. Moreover,\nfor this problem it is NP-hard to obtain an approximation ratio strictly better\nthan (1-1/e).\n  2. Shared quantum entanglement between the sender and the receiver can\nincrease the success probability by a factor of at most 1/(1-1/e). In addition,\nthis factor is tight if one allows an arbitrary non-signaling box between the\nsender and the receiver.\n  3.

The\nrandom matrix is assumed to have identically distributed rows and the maximal\ncoherence is defined as the largest of the $p \\choose 2$ correlation\ncoefficients associated with any row. Likewise, the $k$ nearest neighbor (kNN)\ncoherence is defined as the $k$-th largest of these correlation coefficients.\nThe forms of the pre- and post-change distributions of the observed matrices\nare assumed to belong to the family of elliptically contoured densities with\nsparse dispersion matrices but are otherwise unknown. A non-parametric stopping\nrule is proposed that is based on the maximal k-nearest neighbor sample\ncoherence between columns of each observed random matrix. This is a summary\nstatistic that is related to a test of the existence of a hub vertex in a\nsample correlation graph having a degree at least $k$. Performance bounds on\nthe delay and false alarm performance of the proposed stopping rule are\nobtained in the purely high dimensional regime where $p\\rightarrow \\infty$ and\n$n$ is fixed. When the pre-change dispersion matrix is diagonal it is shown\nthat, among all functions of the proposed summary statistic, the proposed\nstopping rule is asymptotically optimal under a minimax quickest change\ndetection (QCD) model as the stopping threshold approaches infinity.

Here we study random K-satisfiability problems with\n$K=3,4$, which are known to be very hard close to the SAT-UNSAT threshold,\nwhere problems stop having solutions. We show that the backtracking survey\npropagation algorithm, in a time practically linear in the problem size, is\nable to find solutions very close to the threshold, in a region unreachable by\nany other algorithm. All solutions found have no frozen variables, thus\nsupporting the conjecture that only unfrozen solutions can be found in linear\ntime, and that a problem becomes impossible to solve in linear time when all\nsolutions contain frozen variables.

Players' types evolve as conditionally independent\nMarkov processes, conditioned on their current actions. Their actions and types\njointly determine their instantaneous rewards. In dynamic games with asymmetric\ninformation, a widely used concept of equilibrium is perfect Bayesian\nequilibrium (PBE), which consists of a strategy and belief pair that\nsimultaneously satisfy sequential rationality and belief consistency. In\ngeneral, there does not exist a universal algorithm that decouples the\ninterdependence of strategies and beliefs over time in calculating PBE. In this\npaper, for the finite-horizon game with independent types we develop a two-step\nbackward-forward recursive algorithm that sequentially decomposes the problem\n(w.r.t. time) to obtain a subset of PBEs, which we refer to as structured\nBayesian perfect equilibria (SPBE). In such equilibria, a player's strategy\ndepends on its history only through a common public belief and its current\nprivate type. The backward recursive part of this algorithm defines an\nequilibrium generating function. Each period in the backward recursion involves\nsolving a fixed-point equation on the space of probability simplexes for every\npossible belief on types. Using this function, equilibrium strategies and\nbeliefs are generated through a forward recursion. We then extend this\nmethodology to the infinite-horizon model, where we propose a time-invariant\nsingle-shot fixed-point equation, which in conjunction with a forward recursive\nstep, generates the SPBE. Sufficient conditions for the existence of SPBE are\nprovided. With our proposed method, we find equilibria that exhibit signaling\nbehavior. This is illustrated with the help of a concrete public goods example. Comment: 36 pages, 3 figures, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, vol.

Motivated by a study of brain-wide 4D\nimaging of neural activity in C. elegans, we present a new method of multi-cell\ntracking. Data types to which the method is applicable are characterized as\nfollows: (i) cells are imaged as globular-like objects, (ii) it is difficult to\ndistinguish cells based only on shape and size, (iii) the number of imaged\ncells ranges in several hundreds, (iv) moves of nearly-located cells are\nstrongly correlated and (v) cells do not divide. We developed a tracking\nsoftware suite which we call SPF-CellTracker. Incorporating dependency on\ncells' moves into prediction model is the key to reduce the tracking errors:\ncell-switching and coalescence of tracked positions. We model target cells'\ncorrelated moves as a Markov random field and we also derive a fast computation\nalgorithm, which we call spatial particle filter. With the live-imaging data of\nnuclei of C. elegans neurons in which approximately 120 nuclei of neurons are\nimaged, we demonstrate an advantage of the proposed method over the standard\nparticle filter and a method developed by Tokunaga et al.

Hence, we hypothesize that sosie synthesis has different\nperformances on a statement that is covered by one hundred test case and on a\nstatement that is covered by a single test case. We synthesize 24583 sosies on\n6 popular open-source Java programs. Our results show that there are two\ndimensions for diversification. The first one lies in the specification: the\nmore test cases cover a statement, the more difficult it is to synthesize\nsosies. Yet, to our surprise, we are also able to synthesize sosies on highly\ntested statements (up to 600 test cases), which indicates an intrinsic property\nof the programs we study. The second dimension is in the code: we manually\nexplore dozens of sosies and characterize new types of forgiving code regions\nthat are prone to diversification.

Continued availability of a modern data center is the\nresult of a complex orchestration among many internal and external actors\nincluding computing hardware, multiple layers of intricate software, networking\nand storage devices, electrical power and cooling plants. During the course of\ntheir operation, many of these components produce large amounts of data in the\nform of event and error logs that are essential not only for identifying and\nresolving problems but also for improving data center efficiency and\nmanagement. Most of these activities would benefit significantly from data\nanalytics techniques to exploit hidden statistical patterns and correlations\nthat may be present in the data. The sheer volume of data to be analyzed makes\nuncovering these correlations and patterns a challenging task. This paper\npresents BiDAl, a prototype Java tool for log-data analysis that incorporates\nseveral Big Data technologies in order to simplify the task of extracting\ninformation from data traces produced by large clusters and server farms. BiDAl\nprovides the user with several analysis languages (SQL, R and Hadoop MapReduce)\nand storage backends (HDFS and SQLite) that can be freely mixed and matched so\nthat a custom tool for a specific task can be easily constructed. BiDAl has a\nmodular architecture so that it can be extended with other backends and\nanalysis languages in the future. In this paper we present the design of BiDAl\nand describe our experience using it to analyze publicly-available traces from\nGoogle data clusters, with the goal of building a realistic model of a complex\ndata center.

In this paper we derive estimates for average BFS and DFS runtime. The\naverage runtime estimates can be used to allocate resources or judge the\nhardness of a problem. They can also be used for selecting the best graph\nrepresentation, and for selecting the faster algorithm out of BFS and DFS. They\nmay also form the basis for an analysis of more advanced search methods. The\npaper treats both tree search and graph search. For tree search, we employ a\nprobabilistic model of goal distribution; for graph search, the analysis\ndepends on an additional statistic of path redundancy and average branching\nfactor. As an application, we use the results to predict BFS and DFS runtime on\ntwo concrete grammar problems and on the N-puzzle. Experimental verification\nshows that our analytical approximations come close to empirical reality.

We prove an information theoretic phase transition:\nsuch matrices are close in total variation distance to the corresponding\nGaussian ensemble if and only if $d$ is much larger than $n^3$. Our proof is\nentropy-based, making use of the chain rule for relative entropy along with the\nrecursive structure in the definition of the Wishart ensemble. The proof\ncrucially relies on the well known relation between Fisher information and\nentropy, a variational representation for Fisher information, concentration\nbounds for the spectral norm of a random matrix, and certain small ball\nprobability estimates for log-concave measures.

As the viral spreading on social\nnetwork is a global process, it is commonly believed that measuring the\ninfluence of nodes inevitably requires the knowledge of the entire network.\nEmploying percolation theory, we show that the spreading process displays a\nnucleation behavior: once a piece of information spread from the seeds to more\nthan a small characteristic number of nodes, it reaches a point of no return\nand will quickly reach the percolation cluster, regardless of the entire\nnetwork structure, otherwise the spreading will be contained locally. Thus, we\nfind that, without the knowledge of entire network, any nodes' global influence\ncan be accurately measured using this characteristic number, which is\nindependent of the network size. This motivates an efficient algorithm with\nconstant time complexity on the long standing problem of best seed spreaders\nselection, with performance remarkably close to the true optimum.

Most of the work concerning housing markets does not cater\nfor randomized assignments or allocation of time-shares. House allocation with\nfractional endowments of houses was considered by Athanassoglou and Sethuraman\n(2011) who posed the open problem whether individual rationality, weak\nstrategyproofness, and efficiency are compatible for the setting. We show that\nthe three axioms are incompatible.

If not, to what extent does\nthis tend to hold? Such questions were formulated in terms of signed (social)\nnetworks and necessary and sufficient conditions for a network to be \"balanced\"\nwere obtained around 1960. Since then the idea that signed networks tend over\ntime to become more balanced has been widely used in several application areas.\nHowever, investigation of this hypothesis has been complicated by the lack of a\nstandard measure of partial balance, since complete balance is almost never\nachieved in practice. We formalize the concept of a measure of partial balance,\ndiscuss various measures, compare the measures on synthetic datasets, and\ninvestigate their axiomatic properties. The synthetic data involves\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi and specially structured random graphs. We show that some\nmeasures behave better than others in terms of axioms and ability to\ndifferentiate between graphs. We also use well-known datasets from the\nsociology and biology literature, such as Read's New Guinean tribes, gene\nregulatory networks related to two organisms, and a network involving senate\nbill co-sponsorship. Our results show that substantially different levels of\npartial balance is observed under cycle-based, eigenvalue-based, and\nfrustration-based measures. We make some recommendations for measures to be\nused in future work.

By using Maxwell's equations, we derive and present\na Bayesian non-parametric probabilistic modeling approach for interpolation and\nextrapolation of the magnetic field. We model the magnetic field components\njointly by imposing a Gaussian process (GP) prior on the latent scalar\npotential of the magnetic field. By rewriting the GP model in terms of a\nHilbert space representation, we circumvent the computational pitfalls\nassociated with GP modeling and provide a computationally efficient and\nphysically justified modeling tool for the ambient magnetic field.

Theory, Ser. B, 110:47-66, 2015] with the help of tree-cut\ndecompositions. In certain cases, tree-cut width appears to be more adequate\nthan treewidth as an invariant that, when bounded, can accelerate the\nresolution of intractable problems. While designing algorithms for problems\nwith bounded tree-cut width, it is important to have a parametrically tractable\nway to compute the exact value of this parameter or, at least, some constant\napproximation of it. In this paper we give a parameterized 2-approximation\nalgorithm for the computation of tree-cut width; for an input $n$-vertex graph\n$G$ and an integer $w$, our algorithm either confirms that the tree-cut width\nof $G$ is more than $w$ or returns a tree-cut decomposition of $G$ certifying\nthat its tree-cut width is at most $2w$, in time $2^{O(w^2\\log w)} \\cdot n^2$.\nPrior to this work, no constructive parameterized algorithms, even approximated\nones, existed for computing the tree-cut width of a graph. As a consequence of\nthe Graph Minors series by Robertson and Seymour, only the existence of a\ndecision algorithm was known.

For constrained problems,\nit is a common practice to relax linear equality constraints as penalty terms\nin the objective function. However, there has not yet been proposed a method\nfor efficiently dealing with inequality constraints using the quantum adiabatic\napproach. In this paper, we give a method for solving the Lagrangian dual of a\nbinary quadratic programming (BQP) problem in the presence of inequality\nconstraints and employ this procedure within a branch-and-bound framework for\nconstrained BQP (CBQP) problems.

We show that, if the decision version of the problem can be solved in\ntime $f(k) \\cdot poly(n)$, there is a randomised algorithm which enumerates all\nwitnesses in time $e^{k + o(k)} \\cdot f(k) \\cdot poly(n) \\cdot N$, where $N$ is\nthe total number of witnesses. If the decision version of the problem is solved\nby a randomised algorithm which may return false negatives, then the same\nmethod allows us to output a list of witnesses in which any given witness will\nbe included with high probability. The enumeration algorithm also gives rise to\nan efficient algorithm to count the total number of witnesses when this number\nis small. Comment: To appear in Algorithmica.

First, given a set of $n$\nalgebraic plane curves, we show that there are $O(n^{3/2})$ points where two or\nmore curves are tangent. In particular, if no three curves are mutually tangent\nat a common point, then there are $O(n^{3/2})$ curve-curve tangencies. Second,\ngiven a family of algebraic plane curves and a set of $n$ curves from this\nfamily, we show that either there are $O(n^{3/2})$ points where two or more\ncurves are orthogonal, or the family of curves has certain special properties.\n  We obtain these bounds by transforming the arrangement of plane curves into\nan arrangement of space curves so that tangency (or orthogonality) of the\noriginal plane curves corresponds to intersection of space curves. We then\nbound the number of intersections of the corresponding space curves. For the\ncase of curve-curve tangency, we use a polynomial method technique that is\nreminiscent of Guth and Katz's proof of the joints theorem. For the case of\northogonal curve intersections, we employ a bound of Guth and the third author\nto control the number of two-rich points in space curve arrangements.

The elasticity functional to\nbe minimized takes into account two different types of nonlinear energies: a\nmembrane energy measuring the rate of tangential distortion when deforming the\nreference shell into the template shell, and a bending energy measuring the\nbending under the deformation in terms of the change of the shape operators\nfrom the undeformed into the deformed configuration. The variational method\napplies to surfaces described as level sets. It is mathematically well-posed\nand an existence proof of an optimal matching deformation is given. The\nvariational model is implemented using a finite element discretization combined\nwith a narrow band approach on an efficient hierarchical grid structure. For\nthe optimization a regularized nonlinear conjugate gradient scheme and a\ncascadic multilevel strategy are used. The features of the proposed approach\nare studied for synthetic test cases and a collection of geometry processing\nexamples.

This inequality can be\nstrengthened with a remainder term in the form of a distance between $\\rho$ and\nthe closest recovered state $(\\mathcal{R} \\circ \\mathcal{N})(\\rho)$, where\n$\\mathcal{R}$ is a recovery map with the property that $\\sigma = (\\mathcal{R}\n\\circ \\mathcal{N})(\\sigma)$. We show the existence of an explicit recovery map\nthat is universal in the sense that it depends only on $\\sigma$ and the quantum\nchannel $\\mathcal{N}$ to be reversed.

The proposed control strategy approximates the unknown dynamics\nthrough time-delayed logic, and the switching logic provides robustness against\nthe approximation error. The novel adaptation law for the switching gain, in\ncontrast to the conventional adaptive-robust control methodologies, does not\nrequire either nominal modelling or predefined bounds of the uncertainties.\nAlso, the proposed adaptive law circumvents the overestimation-underestimation\nproblem of switching gain. The state derivatives in the proposed control law is\nestimated from past data of the state to alleviate the measurement error when\nstate derivatives are not available directly. Moreover, a new stability notion\nfor time-delayed control is proposed which in turn provides a selection\ncriterion for controller gain and sampling interval. Experimental result of the\nproposed methodology using a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot (WMR) is\npresented and improved tracking accuracy of the proposed control law is noted\ncompared to time-delayed control and adaptive sliding mode control. Comment: 9 pages", "1509.07330": "Pricing Policies for Selling Indivisible Storable Goods to Strategic\n  Consumers,We study the dynamic pricing problem faced by a monopolistic retailer who\nsells a storable product to forward-looking consumers. In this framework, the\ntwo major pricing policies (or mechanisms) studied in the literature are the\npreannounced (commitment) pricing policy and the contingent (threat or history\ndependent) pricing policy. We analyse and compare these pricing policies in the\nsetting where the good can be purchased along a finite time horizon in\nindivisible atomic quantities. First, we show that, given linear storage costs,\nthe retailer can compute an optimal preannounced pricing policy in polynomial\ntime by solving a dynamic program. Moreover, under such a policy, we show that\nconsumers do not need to store units in order to anticipate price rises.\nSecond, under the contingent pricing policy rather than the preannounced\npricing mechanism, (i) prices could be lower, (ii) retailer revenues could be\nhigher, and (iii) consumer surplus could be higher. This result is surprising,\nin that these three facts are in complete contrast to the case of a retailer\nselling divisible storable goods Dudine et al. (2006). Third, we quantify\nexactly how much more profitable a contingent policy could be with respect to a\npreannounced policy. Specifically, for a market with $N$ consumers, a\ncontingent policy can produce a multiplicative factor of $\\Omega(\\log N)$ more\nrevenues than a preannounced policy, and this bound is tight.

In this novel approach, they are deployed\nalongside trucks to deliver goods to customers to improve the quality of\nservice and reduce the transportation cost. This approach gives rise to a new\nvariant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), called TSP with drone (TSP-D).\nA variant of this problem that aims to minimize the time at which truck and\ndrone finish the service (or, in other words, to maximize the quality of\nservice) was studied in the work of Murray and Chu (2015). In contrast, this\npaper considers a new variant of TSP-D in which the objective is to minimize\noperational costs including total transportation cost and one created by waste\ntime a vehicle has to wait for the other. The problem is first formulated\nmathematically. Then, two algorithms are proposed for the solution. The first\nalgorithm (TSP-LS) was adapted from the approach proposed by Murray and Chu\n(2015), in which an optimal TSP solution is converted to a feasible TSP-D\nsolution by local searches. The second algorithm, a Greedy Randomized Adaptive\nSearch Procedure (GRASP), is based on a new split procedure that optimally\nsplits any TSP tour into a TSP-D solution. After a TSP-D solution has been\ngenerated, it is then improved through local search operators. Numerical\nresults obtained on various instances of both objective functions with\ndifferent sizes and characteristics are presented. The results show that GRASP\noutperforms TSP-LS in terms of solution quality under an acceptable running\ntime.

Poisson observations in particular are\na feature of several real-world applications. Previous work on sparse Poisson\ninverse problems encountered several limiting technical hurdles. This paper\ndescribes a novel alternative analysis approach for sparse Poisson inverse\nproblems that (a) sidesteps the technical challenges in previous work, (b)\nadmits estimators that can readily be computed using off-the-shelf LASSO\nalgorithms, and (c) hints at a general framework for broad classes of noise in\nsparse linear inverse problems. At the heart of this new approach lies a\nweighted LASSO estimator for which data-dependent weights are based on Poisson\nconcentration inequalities. Unlike previous analyses of the weighted LASSO, the\nproposed analysis depends on conditions which can be checked or shown to hold\nin general settings with high probability.

Using large written corpora for many different languages\nand scripts, we show that the occurrence probability distributions of signs at\nthe left and right ends of words have a distinct heterogeneous nature.\nCharacterizing this asymmetry using quantitative inequality measures, viz.\ninformation entropy and the Gini index, we show that the beginning of a word is\nless restrictive in sign usage than the end. This property is not simply\nattributable to the use of common affixes as it is seen even when only word\nroots are considered. We use the existence of this asymmetry to infer the\ndirection of writing in undeciphered inscriptions that agrees with the\narchaeological evidence. Unlike traditional investigations of phonotactic\nconstraints which focus on language-specific patterns, our study reveals a\nproperty valid across languages and writing systems. As both language and\nwriting are unique aspects of our species, this universal signature may reflect\nan innate feature of the human cognitive phenomenon.

Robust PCA aims at recovering a low-rank matrix that was\nperturbed with sparse noise, with applications for example in\nforeground-background video separation. Although $\\ell_1$-LRA is strongly\nbelieved to be NP-hard, there is, to the best of our knowledge, no formal proof\nof this fact. In this paper, we prove that $\\ell_1$-LRA is NP-hard, already in\nthe rank-one case, using a reduction from MAX CUT. Our derivations draw\ninteresting connections between $\\ell_1$-LRA and several other well-known\nproblems, namely, robust PCA, $\\ell_0$-LRA, binary matrix factorization, a\nparticular densest bipartite subgraph problem, the computation of the cut norm\nof $\\{-1,+1\\}$ matrices, and the discrete basis problem, which we all prove to\nbe NP-hard.

As main\ncontribution the coding theorem is proved for a significantly weaker condition\non the channel output memory - called total ergodicity w.r.t. finite alphabet\nblock-memoryless input sources - and under a crucial relaxation of the\nmeasurability requirement for the channel. These improvements are achieved by\nintroducing a suitable characterization of information rate capacity. It is\nshown that the $\\psi$-mixing output memory condition used by Kadota and Wyner\nis quite restrictive and excludes important channel models, in particular for\nthe class of Gaussian channels. In fact, it is proved that for Gaussian (e.g.,\nfading or additive noise) channels the $\\psi$-mixing condition is equivalent to\nfinite output memory. Further, it is demonstrated that the measurability\nrequirement of Kadota and Wyner is not satisfied for relevant continuous-time\nchannel models such as linear filters, whereas the condition used in this paper\nis satisfied for these models. Moreover, a weak converse is derived for all\nstationary channels with time structure. Intersymbol interference as well as\ninput constraints are taken into account in a general and flexible way,\nincluding amplitude and average power constraints as special case. Formulated\nin rigorous mathematical terms complete, explicit, and transparent proofs are\npresented. As a side product a gap in the proof of Kadota and Wyner -\nillustrated by a counterexample - is closed by providing a corrected proof of a\nlemma on the monotonicity of some sequence of normalized mutual information\nquantities. An abstract framework is established to treat discrete- and\ncontinuous-time channels with memory and arbitrary alphabets in a unified way.

They proved\nthat if $D$ is $s$-shellable for some $s\\geq\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor$, then\n$D$ has at least $H(n)$ crossings. This is the first combinatorial condition on\na drawing that guarantees at least $H(n)$ crossings. In this work, we\ngeneralize the concept of $s$-shellability to bishellability, where the former\nimplies the latter in the sense that every $s$-shellable drawing is, for any $b\n\\leq s-2$, also $b$-bishellable. Our main result is that $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\n\\rfloor\\!-\\!2)$-bishellability of a drawing $D$ of $K_n$ also guarantees, with\na simpler proof than for $s$-shellability, that $D$ has at least $H(n)$\ncrossings. We exhibit a drawing of $K_{11}$ that has $H(11)$ crossings, is\n3-bishellable, and is not $s$-shellable for any $s\\geq5$. This shows that we\nhave properly extended the class of drawings for which the Harary-Hill\nConjecture is proved. Moreover, we provide an infinite family of drawings of\n$K_n$ that are $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor\\!-\\!2)$-bishellable, but not\n$s$-shellable for any $s\\geq\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor$.

The unit disk graph\n$\\text{UD}(S)$ on $S$ has vertex set $S$ and an edge between two distinct sites\n$s,t \\in S$ if and only if $s$ and $t$ have Euclidean distance $|st| \\leq 1$.\n  A routing scheme $R$ for $\\text{UD}(S)$ assigns to each site $s \\in S$ a\nlabel $\\ell(s)$ and a routing table $\\rho(s)$. For any two sites $s, t \\in S$,\nthe scheme $R$ must be able to route a packet from $s$ to $t$ in the following\nway: given a current site $r$ (initially, $r = s$), a header $h$ (initially\nempty), and the label $\\ell(t)$ of the target, the scheme $R$ consults the\nrouting table $\\rho(r)$ to compute a neighbor $r'$ of $r$, a new header $h'$,\nand the label $\\ell(t')$ of an intermediate target $t'$. (The label of the\noriginal target may be stored at the header $h'$.) The packet is then routed to\n$r'$, and the procedure is repeated until the packet reaches $t$. The resulting\nsequence of sites is called the routing path. The stretch of $R$ is the maximum\nratio of the (Euclidean) length of the routing path produced by $R$ and the\nshortest path in $\\text{UD}(S)$, over all pairs of distinct sites in $S$.\n  For any given $\\varepsilon > 0$, we show how to construct a routing scheme\nfor $\\text{UD}(S)$ with stretch $1+\\varepsilon$ using labels of $O(\\log n)$\nbits and routing tables of $O(\\varepsilon^{-5}\\log^2 n \\log^2 D)$ bits, where\n$D$ is the (Euclidean) diameter of $\\text{UD}(S)$. The header size is $O(\\log n\n\\log D)$ bits.

To illustrate\nthese findings we show a series of behavioural boundary crossing results,\nincluding emulations (for all initial conditions) of Wolfram class 2 Elementary\nCellular Automata (ECA) by Class 1 ECA, emulations of Classes 1, 2 and 3 ECA by\nClass 2 and 3 ECA, and of Classes 1, 2 and 3 by Class 3 ECA, along with results\nof even greater emulability for general CA (neighbourhood $r=3/2$), including\nClass 1 CA emulating Classes 2 and 3, and Classes 3 and 4 emulating all other\nclasses (1, 2, 3 and 4).

For any discrete source-channel pair, the contraction\ncoefficients for $f$-divergences are lower bounded by the contraction\ncoefficient for $\\chi^2$-divergence. In this paper, we elucidate that this\nlower bound can be achieved by driving the input $f$-divergences of the\ncontraction coefficients to zero. Then, we establish a linear upper bound on\nthe contraction coefficients for a certain class of $f$-divergences using the\ncontraction coefficient for $\\chi^2$-divergence, and refine this upper bound\nfor the salient special case of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Furthermore,\nwe present an alternative proof of the fact that the contraction coefficients\nfor KL and $\\chi^2$-divergences are equal for a Gaussian source with an\nadditive Gaussian noise channel (where the former coefficient can be power\nconstrained). Finally, we generalize the well-known result that contraction\ncoefficients of channels (after extremizing over all possible sources) for all\n$f$-divergences with non-linear operator convex $f$ are equal. In particular,\nwe prove that the so called \"less noisy\" preorder over channels can be\nequivalently characterized by any non-linear operator convex $f$-divergence.

The Baire Category Theorem can be\nseen as a pigeonhole principle that states that a complete (i.e., \"large\")\nmetric space cannot be decomposed into countably many nowhere dense (i.e.,\n\"small\") pieces. The Baire Category Theorem is an illuminating example of a\ntheorem that can be used to demonstrate that one classical theorem can have\nseveral different computational interpretations. For one, we distinguish two\ndifferent logical versions of the theorem, where one can be seen as the\ncontrapositive form of the other one. The first version aims to find an\nuncovered point in the space, given a sequence of nowhere dense closed sets.\nThe second version aims to find the index of a closed set that is somewhere\ndense, given a sequence of closed sets that cover the space. Even though the\ntwo statements behind these versions are equivalent to each other in classical\nlogic, they are not equivalent in intuitionistic logic and likewise they\nexhibit different computational behavior in the Weihrauch lattice. Besides this\nlogical distinction, we also consider different ways how the sequence of closed\nsets is \"given\". Essentially, we can distinguish between positive and negative\ninformation on closed sets. We discuss all the four resulting versions of the\nBaire Category Theorem. Somewhat surprisingly it turns out that the difference\nin providing the input information can also be expressed with the jump\noperation. Finally, we also relate the Baire Category Theorem to notions of\ngenericity and computably comeager sets.

By\nexploiting both the horizontal and the vertical relationship among vertices,\nwindrose-planar drawings allow to simultaneously visualize two partial orders\ndefined by means of the edges of the graph.\n  Although the problem is NP-hard in the general case, we give a\npolynomial-time algorithm for testing whether there exists a windrose-planar\ndrawing that respects a given combinatorial embedding. This algorithm is based\non a characterization of the plane triangulations admitting a windrose-planar\ndrawing. Furthermore, for any embedded graph with $n$ vertices that has a\nwindrose-planar drawing, we can construct one with at most one bend per edge\nand with at most $2n-5$ bends in total, which lies on the $3n \\times 3n$ grid.\nThe latter result contrasts with the fact that straight-line windrose-planar\ndrawings may require exponential area.

We show that a belief propagation\nalgorithm achieves weak recovery if $\\lambda>1/e$, beyond the Kesten-Stigum\nthreshold by a factor of $1/e.$ The belief propagation algorithm only needs to\nrun for $\\log^\\ast n+O(1) $ iterations, with the total time complexity $O(|E|\n\\log^*n)$, where $\\log^*n$ is the iterated logarithm of $n.$ Conversely, if\n$\\lambda \\leq 1/e$, no local algorithm can asymptotically outperform trivial\nrandom guessing. Furthermore, a linear message-passing algorithm that\ncorresponds to applying power iteration to the non-backtracking matrix of the\ngraph is shown to attain weak recovery if and only if $\\lambda>1$.

If this rough definition is not enough, then a mathematician\nmay provide a formal definition of the real numbers in the set theoretic and\naxiomatic fashion, i.e. via Cauchy sequences or Dedekind cuts, or as the\ncollection of axioms characterizing exactly (up to isomorphism) the set of real\nnumbers as the complete and totally ordered Archimedean field. Actually, the\nabove notions of the real numbers are abstract and do not have a constructive\ngrounding. Definition of Cauchy sequences, and equivalence classes of these\nsequences explicitly use the actual infinity. The same is for Dedekind cuts,\nwhere the set of rational numbers is used as actual infinity. Although there is\nno direct constructive grounding for these abstract notions, there are so\ncalled intuitions on which they are based. A rigorous approach to express these\nvery intuition in a constructive way is proposed. It is based on the concept of\nthe adjacency relation that seems to be a missing primitive concept in type\ntheory. The approach corresponds to the intuitionistic view of Continuum\nproposed by Brouwer. The famous and controversial Brouwer Continuity Theorem is\ndiscussed on the basis of different principle than the Axiom of Continuity. The\nreal numbers are the cornerstone of Calculus, Homotopy theory, Riemannian\ngeometry, and many others important subjects. The proposed grounding of\nContinuum is discussed in the context of these subjects.

Frequently this word is a fixed point of a\nuniform morphism, or closely related to one. For example, the lexicographically\nleast $7/4$-power-free word is a fixed point of a $50847$-uniform morphism. We\nidentify the structure of the lexicographically least $a/b$-power-free word for\nthree infinite families of rationals $a/b$ as well many \"sporadic\" rationals\nthat do not seem to belong to general families. To accomplish this, we develop\nan automated procedure for proving $a/b$-power-freeness for morphisms of a\ncertain form, both for explicit and symbolic rational numbers $a/b$. Finally,\nwe establish a connection to words on a finite alphabet. Namely, the\nlexicographically least $27/23$-power-free word is in fact a word on the finite\nalphabet $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$, and its sequence of letters is $353$-automatic.

Classic cake-cutting\nprocedures either allocate each agent a collection of disconnected pieces, or\nassume that the cake is a one-dimensional interval. In practice, however, the\ntwo-dimensional shape of the allotted pieces is important. In particular, when\nbuilding a house or designing an advertisement in printed or electronic media,\nsquares are more usable than long and narrow rectangles. We thus introduce and\nstudy the problem of fair two-dimensional division wherein the allotted pieces\nmust be of some restricted two-dimensional geometric shape(s), particularly\nsquares and fat rectangles. Adding such geometric constraints re-opens most\nquestions and challenges related to cake-cutting. Indeed, even the most\nelementary fairness criterion --- proportionality --- can no longer be\nguaranteed. In this paper we thus examine the level of proportionality that can\nbe guaranteed, providing both impossibility results and constructive division\nprocedures.

Given a triangular mesh and a\nuser assigned polygon/vertex budget, traditional methods usually require the\nextra curvature metric field for the desired anisotropy to best approximate the\nsurface, even though the estimated curvature metric is known to be imperfect\nand already self-contained in the surface. In our approach, this anisotropic\ncontrol is achieved through the optimal geometry partition without this\nexplicit metric field. The minimization of our proposed partition energy has\nthe following properties: Firstly, on a C2 surface, it is theoretically\nguaranteed to have the optimal aspect ratio and cluster size as specified in\napproximation theory for L1 piecewise linear approximation. Secondly, it\ncaptures sharp features on practical models without any pre-tagging. We develop\nan effective merging-swapping framework to seek the optimal partition and\nconstruct polygonal/triangular mesh afterwards.

However, current e-manga\narchives offer very limited search support, including keyword-based search by\ntitle or author, or tag-based categorization. To make the manga search\nexperience more intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable, we propose a content-based\nmanga retrieval system. First, we propose a manga-specific image-describing\nframework. It consists of efficient margin labeling, edge orientation histogram\nfeature description, and approximate nearest-neighbor search using product\nquantization. Second, we propose a sketch-based interface as a natural way to\ninteract with manga content. The interface provides sketch-based querying,\nrelevance feedback, and query retouch. For evaluation, we built a novel dataset\nof manga images, Manga109, which consists of 109 comic books of 21,142 pages\ndrawn by professional manga artists. To the best of our knowledge, Manga109 is\ncurrently the biggest dataset of manga images available for research. We\nconducted a comparative study, a localization evaluation, and a large-scale\nqualitative study. From the experiments, we verified that: (1) the retrieval\naccuracy of the proposed method is higher than those of previous methods; (2)\nthe proposed method can localize an object instance with reasonable runtime and\naccuracy; and (3) sketch querying is useful for manga search.

First, a novel criterion for the general\ncharacterization of least favorable distributions is proposed, which unifies\nexisting results. This criterion is then used to derive an implicit definition\nof the least favorable distributions under band uncertainties. In contrast to\nthe existing solution, it only requires two scalar values to be determined and\neliminates the need for case-by-case statements. Based on this definition, a\ngeneric fixed-point algorithm is proposed that iteratively calculates the least\nfavorable distributions for arbitrary band specifications. Finally, three\ndifferent types of robust tests that emerge from band models are discussed and\na numerical example is presented to illustrate their potential use in practice.

Resource- and population-monotonicity relate to\nscenarios where the cake, or the number of participants who divide the cake,\nchanges. It is required that the utility of all participants change in the same\ndirection: either all of them are better-off (if there is more to share or\nfewer to share among) or all are worse-off (if there is less to share or more\nto share among).\n  We formally introduce these concepts to the cake-cutting problem and examine\nwhether they are satisfied by various common division rules. We prove that the\nNash-optimal rule, which maximizes the product of utilities, is\nresource-monotonic and population-monotonic, in addition to being\nPareto-optimal, envy-free and satisfying a strong competitive-equilibrium\ncondition.

The processor runs in the\nencrypted mode (the unprivileged, `user' mode, with a long pipeline) at 60-70%\nof the speed in the unencrypted mode (the privileged, `supervisor' mode, with a\nshort pipeline), emitting a completed encrypted instruction every 1.67-1.8\ncycles on average in real trials.

We study an optimization strategy that directly\nuses an estimate of the argmax of the function. This strategy offers both\npractical and theoretical advantages: no tradeoff parameter needs to be\nselected, and, moreover, we establish close connections to the popular GP-UCB\nand GP-PI strategies. Our approach can be understood as automatically and\nadaptively trading off exploration and exploitation in GP-UCB and GP-PI. We\nillustrate the effects of this adaptive tuning via bounds on the regret as well\nas an extensive empirical evaluation on robotics and vision tasks,\ndemonstrating the robustness of this strategy for a range of performance\ncriteria.

We propose a novel\nformulation of the network alignment problem that extends topological\nsimilarity to higher-order structures and provides a new objective function\nthat maximizes the number of aligned substructures. This objective function\ncorresponds to an integer programming problem, which is NP-hard. Consequently,\nwe identify a closely related surrogate function whose maximization results in\na tensor eigenvector problem. Based on this formulation, we present an\nalgorithm called Triangular AlignMEnt (TAME), which attempts to maximize the\nnumber of aligned triangles across networks. Using a case study on the\nNAPAbench dataset, we show that triangular alignment is capable of producing\nmappings with high node correctness. We further evaluate our method by aligning\nyeast and human interactomes. Our results indicate that TAME outperforms the\nstate-of-art alignment methods in terms of conserved triangles. In addition, we\nshow that the number of conserved triangles is more significantly correlated,\ncompared to the conserved edge, with node correctness and co-expression of\nedges. Our formulation and resulting algorithms can be easily extended to\narbitrary motifs.

In its most general form, SLAP\ninduces a continuous POMDP (partially-observable Markov decision process),\nwhich needs to be repeatedly solved online. This paper addresses this problem\nand proposes a dynamic replanning scheme in belief space. The underlying POMDP,\nwhich is continuous in state, action, and observation space, is approximated\noffline via sampling-based methods, but operates in a replanning loop online to\nadmit local improvements to the coarse offline policy. This construct enables\nthe proposed method to combat changing environments and large localization\nerrors, even when the change alters the homotopy class of the optimal\ntrajectory. It further outperforms the state-of-the-art FIRM (Feedback-based\nInformation RoadMap) method by eliminating unnecessary stabilization steps.\nApplying belief space planning to physical systems brings with it a plethora of\nchallenges. A key focus of this paper is to implement the proposed planner on a\nphysical robot and show the SLAP solution performance under uncertainty, in\nchanging environments and in the presence of large disturbances, such as a\nkidnapped robot situation.

A linear programming degree\ndistribution optimization problem is defined for Raptor codes in the low SNR\nregime through several approximations. We also provide an exact expression for\nthe polynomial representation of the degree distribution with infinite maximum\ndegree in the low SNR regime, which enables us to calculate the exact value of\nthe fractions of output nodes of small degrees. A more practical degree\ndistribution design is also proposed for Raptor codes in the low SNR regime,\nwhere we include the rate efficiency and the decoding complexity in the\noptimization problem, and an upper bound on the maximum rate efficiency is\nderived for given design parameters. Simulation results show that the Raptor\ncode with the designed degree distributions can approach rate efficiencies\nlarger than 0.95 in the low SNR regime.

Exploiting recent results on\ncontraction analysis of switched Filippov systems derived using regularization,\nsufficient conditions are presented to prove incremental stability of the\nclosed-loop system. Furthermore, based on these sufficient conditions, a design\nprocedure is proposed to design a switched control action that is active only\nwhere the open-loop system is not sufficiently incrementally stable in order to\nreduce the required control effort. The design procedure to either locally or\nglobally incrementally stabilize a dynamical system is then illustrated by\nmeans of a representative example. Comment: Accepted to ECC 2016", "1510.08417": "Monotone Projection Lower Bounds from Extended Formulation Lower Bounds,In this short note, we reduce lower bounds on monotone projections of\npolynomials to lower bounds on extended formulations of polytopes. Applying our\nreduction to the seminal extended formulation lower bounds of Fiorini, Massar,\nPokutta, Tiwari, & de Wolf (STOC 2012; J. ACM, 2015) and Rothvoss (STOC 2014;\nJ. ACM, 2017), we obtain the following interesting consequences.\n  1. The Hamiltonian Cycle polynomial is not a monotone subexponential-size\nprojection of the permanent; this both rules out a natural attempt at a\nmonotone lower bound on the Boolean permanent, and shows that the permanent is\nnot complete for non-negative polynomials in VNP$_{{\\mathbb R}}$ under monotone\np-projections.\n  2. The cut polynomials and the perfect matching polynomial (or \"unsigned\nPfaffian\") are not monotone p-projections of the permanent. The latter, over\nthe Boolean and-or semi-ring, rules out monotone reductions in one of the\nnatural approaches to reducing perfect matchings in general graphs to perfect\nmatchings in bipartite graphs.\n  As the permanent is universal for monotone formulas, these results also imply\nexponential lower bounds on the monotone formula size and monotone circuit size\nof these polynomials.

The main motivation of this paper is to investigate the\neffect of the hyperbolicity measure $\\delta$ on expansion and cut-size bounds\non graphs (here $\\delta$ need not be a constant), and the asymptotic ranges of\n$\\delta$ for which these results may provide improved approximation algorithms\nfor related combinatorial problems. To this effect, we provide constructive\nbounds on node expansions for $\\delta$-hyperbolic graphs as a function of\n$\\delta$, and show that many witnesses (subsets of nodes) for such expansions\ncan be computed efficiently even if the witnesses are required to be nested or\nsufficiently distinct from each other. To the best of our knowledge, these are\nthe first such constructive bounds proven. We also show how to find a large\nfamily of s-t cuts with relatively small number of cut-edges when s and t are\nsufficiently far apart. We then provide algorithmic consequences of these\nbounds and their related proof techniques for two problems for\n$\\delta$-hyperbolic graphs (where $\\delta$ is a function $f$ of the number of\nnodes, the exact nature of growth of $f$ being dependent on the particular\nproblem considered).

The ${\\rm CAT}(0)$-metric of Billera-Holmes-Vogtman arises from\nthe theory of orthant spaces. While its geodesics can be computed by the\nOwen-Provan algorithm, geodesic triangles are complicated. We show that the\ndimension of such a triangle can be arbitrarily high. Tropical convexity and\nthe tropical metric behave better. They exhibit properties desirable for\ngeometric statistics, such as geodesics of small depth.

This problem has applications to\nquantum process tomography, when the unknown process is a unitary operation.\n  We show that PhaseLift, a convex programming algorithm for phase retrieval,\ncan be adapted to this matrix setting, using measurements that are sampled from\nunitary 4- and 2-designs. In the case of unitary 4-design measurements, we show\nthat PhaseLift can reconstruct all unitary matrices, using a near-optimal\nnumber of measurements. This extends previous work on PhaseLift using spherical\n4-designs.\n  In the case of unitary 2-design measurements, we show that PhaseLift still\nworks pretty well on average: it recovers almost all signals, up to a constant\nadditive error, using a near-optimal number of measurements.

Consistency implies that these\nmethods are effective at computing the expected value of a point at a future\ntime given the present coordinates. However, the present coordinates themselves\nare noisy, and therefore, these methods are not necessarily effective at\nremoving noise. In this article, we consider denoising and prediction as\nseparate problems for flows, as opposed to discrete time dynamical systems, and\nshow that the use of smooth splines is more effective at removing noise.\nCombination of smooth splines and kernel based regression yields predictors\nthat are more accurate on benchmarks typically by a factor of 2 or more. We\nprove that kernel based regression in combination with smooth splines converges\nto the exact predictor for time series extracted from any compact invariant set\nof any sufficiently smooth flow. As a consequence of convergence, one can find\nexamples where the combination of kernel based regression with smooth splines\nis superior by even a factor of $100$. The predictors that we compute operate\non delay coordinate data and not the full state vector, which is typically not\nobservable.

The goal is to minimize the number of used bins.\nIn this paper, we present an online bin packing algorithm with asymptotic\ncompetitive ratio of 1.5813. This is the first improvement in fifteen years and\nreduces the gap to the lower bound by 15%. Within the well-known SuperHarmonic\nframework, no competitive ratio below 1.58333 can be achieved.\n  We make two crucial changes to that framework. First, some of our algorithm's\ndecisions depend on exact sizes of items, instead of only their types. In\nparticular, for each item with size in (1/3,1/2], we use its exact size to\ndetermine if it can be packed together with an item of size greater than 1/2.\nSecond, we add constraints to the linear programs considered by Seiden, in\norder to better lower bound the optimal solution. These extra constraints are\nbased on marks that we give to items based on how they are packed by our\nalgorithm. We show that for each input, a single weighting function can be\nconstructed to upper bound the competitive ratio on it.\n  We use this idea to simplify the analysis of SuperHarmonic, and show that the\nalgorithm Harmonic++ is in fact 1.58880-competitive (Seiden proved 1.58889),\nand that 1.5884 can be achieved within the SuperHarmonic framework. Finally, we\ngive a lower bound of 1.5762 for our new framework.

Upon repeated stimulus, peripheral network\nnodes remodel the network core that encodes the attractor of the new response.\nThis \"core-periphery learning\" theory reviews and generalizes the heretofore\nfragmented knowledge on attractor formation by neural networks,\nperiphery-driven innovation and a number of recent reports on the adaptation of\nprotein, neuronal and social networks.

The second algorithm does\nnot modify structure, but only the parameter (thresholds) associated with\ndecision nodes.

If $G$\nadmits an $H$-coloring, then we will write $H\\prec G$. The Petersen coloring\nconjecture of Jaeger states that for any bridgeless cubic graph $G$, one has:\n$P\\prec G$. The second author has recently introduced the Sylvester coloring\nconjecture, which states that for any cubic graph $G$ one has: $S\\prec G$. Here\n$S$ is the Sylvester graph on $10$ vertices. In this paper, we prove the\nanalogue of Sylvester coloring conjecture for cubic pseudo-graphs. Moreover, we\nshow that if $G$ is any connected simple cubic graph $G$ with $G\\prec P$, then\n$G = P$. This implies that the Petersen graph does not admit an\n$S_{16}$-coloring, where $S_{16}$ is the smallest connected simple cubic graph\nwithout a perfect matching. $S_{16}$ has $16$ vertices. %We conjecture that\nthere are infinitely many connected cubic simple graphs which do not admit an\n%$S_{16}$-coloring. Finally, we obtain $2$ results towards the Sylvester\ncoloring conjecture. The first result states that any cubic graph $G$ has a\ncoloring with edges of Sylvester graph $S$ such that at least $\\frac45$ of\nvertices of $G$ meet the conditions of Sylvester coloring conjecture. The\nsecond result states that any claw-free cubic graph graph admits an\n$S$-coloring. This results is an application of our result on cubic\npseudo-graphs.

For\nsuch problems, the central scientific questions are: Under what conditions is\nthe information contained in the measurements sufficient for a satisfactory\ninference to be possible? What are the most efficient algorithms for this task?\nA growing body of work has shown that often we can understand and locate these\nfundamental barriers by thinking of them as phase transitions in the sense of\nstatistical physics. Moreover, it turned out that we can use the gained\nphysical insight to develop new promising algorithms. Connection between\ninference and statistical physics is currently witnessing an impressive\nrenaissance and we review here the current state-of-the-art, with a pedagogical\nfocus on the Ising model which formulated as an inference problem we call the\nplanted spin glass. In terms of applications we review two classes of problems:\n(i) inference of clusters on graphs and networks, with community detection as a\nspecial case and (ii) estimating a signal from its noisy linear measurements,\nwith compressed sensing as a case of sparse estimation.

It is known that, when the allotted pieces must\nbe connected, the problem cannot be solved by a finite algorithm for 3 or more\nagents. The impossibility result, however, assumes that the entire cake must be\nallocated. In this paper we replace the entire-allocation requirement with a\nweaker \\emph{partial-proportionality} requirement: the piece given to each\nagent must be worth for it at least a certain positive fraction of the entire\ncake value. We prove that this version of the problem is solvable in bounded\ntime even when the pieces must be connected. We present simple, bounded-time\nenvy-free cake-cutting algorithms for: (1) giving each of $n$ agents a\nconnected piece with a positive value; (2) giving each of 3 agents a connected\npiece worth at least 1/3; (3) giving each of 4 agents a connected piece worth\nat least 1/7; (4) giving each of 4 agents a disconnected piece worth at least\n1/4; (5) giving each of $n$ agents a disconnected piece worth at least\n$(1-\\epsilon)/n$ for any positive $\\epsilon$.

When training data are obtained from internet, the labels are\nlikely to be ambiguous and inaccurate. This paper presents a Light CNN\nframework to learn a compact embedding on the large-scale face data with\nmassive noisy labels. First, we introduce a variation of maxout activation,\ncalled Max-Feature-Map (MFM), into each convolutional layer of CNN. Different\nfrom maxout activation that uses many feature maps to linearly approximate an\narbitrary convex activation function, MFM does so via a competitive\nrelationship. MFM can not only separate noisy and informative signals but also\nplay the role of feature selection between two feature maps. Second, three\nnetworks are carefully designed to obtain better performance meanwhile reducing\nthe number of parameters and computational costs. Lastly, a semantic\nbootstrapping method is proposed to make the prediction of the networks more\nconsistent with noisy labels. Experimental results show that the proposed\nframework can utilize large-scale noisy data to learn a Light model that is\nefficient in computational costs and storage spaces. The learned single network\nwith a 256-D representation achieves state-of-the-art results on various face\nbenchmarks without fine-tuning.

Two isolated Senders are given binary strings $X$ and $Y$ respectively;\nthe length of each string is equal to $n$, and the Hamming distance between the\nstrings is at most $\\alpha n$. The Senders compress their strings and\ncommunicate the results to the Receiver. Then the Receiver must reconstruct\nboth strings $X$ and $Y$. The aim is to minimise the lengths of the transmitted\nmessages.\n  For an asymmetric variant of this problem (where one of the Senders transmits\nthe input string to the Receiver without compression) with deterministic\nencoding a nontrivial lower bound was found by A.Orlitsky and K.Viswanathany.\nIn our paper we prove a new lower bound for the schemes with syndrome coding,\nwhere at least one of the Senders uses linear encoding of the input string.\n  For the combinatorial Slepian-Wolf problem with randomized encoding the\ntheoretical optimum of communication complexity was recently found by the first\nauthor, though effective protocols with optimal lengths of messages remained\nunknown. We close this gap and present a polynomial time randomized protocol\nthat achieves the optimal communication complexity. Comment: 20 pages, 14 figures.

However, the in-network caching is vulnerable to cache pollution\nattacks (CPA), which can reduce cache hits by violating cache locality and\nsignificantly degrade the overall performance of NDN. To defend against CPA\nattacks, the most effective way is to first detect the attacks and then\nthrottle them. Since the CPA attack itself has already imposed a huge burden on\nvictims, to avoid exhausting the remaining resources on the victims for\ndetection purpose, we expect a lightweight detection solution. We thus propose\nELDA, an Efficient and Lightweight Detection scheme against cache pollution\nAttacks, in which we design a Lightweight Flajolet-Martin (LFM) sketch to\nmonitor the interest traffic. Our analysis and simulations demonstrate that, by\nconsuming a few computation and memory resources, ELDA can effectively and\nefficiently detect CPA attacks.

Since many years\nboth the theory and an efficient design of the related algorithm have been\nsolidly established.\n  This paper presents a general definition of polynomial reduction structure,\nstudies its features and highlights the aspects needed in order to grant and to\nefficiently test the main properties (noetherianity, confluence, ideal\nmembership).\n  The most significant aspect of this analysis is a negative reappraisal of the\nrole of the notion of term order which is usually considered a central and\ncrucial tool in the theory. In fact, as it was already established in the\ncomputer science context in relation with termination of algorithms, most of\nthe properties can be obtained simply considering a well-founded ordering,\nwhile the classical requirement that it be preserved by multiplication is\nirrelevant.\n  The last part of the paper shows how the polynomial basis concepts present in\nliterature are interpreted in our language and their properties are\nconsequences of the general results established in the first part of the paper.

Codimension 2,We study conditions under which a finite simplicial complex $K$ can be mapped\nto $\\mathbb R^d$ without higher-multiplicity intersections. An almost\n$r$-embedding is a map $f: K\\to \\mathbb R^d$ such that the images of any $r$\npairwise disjoint simplices of $K$ do not have a common point.

In 2015, Qian et al. have shown that the use of a\ndeep learning approach that jointly learns and computes the features, is very\npromising for the steganalysis. In this paper, we follow-up the study of Qian\net al., and show that, due to intrinsic joint minimization, the results\nobtained from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a Fully Connected Neural\nNetwork (FNN), if well parameterized, surpass the conventional use of a RM with\nan EC. First, numerous experiments were conducted in order to find the best \"\nshape \" of the CNN. Second, experiments were carried out in the clairvoyant\nscenario in order to compare the CNN and FNN to an RM with an EC. The results\nshow more than 16% reduction in the classification error with our CNN or FNN.\nThird, experiments were also performed in a cover-source mismatch setting.

However, solving inverse problems with sparsifying\ndictionaries can be computationally expensive, especially when the dictionary\nunder consideration has a large number of atoms. In this paper, we incorporate\nadditional structure on to dictionary-based sparse representations for visual\nsignals to enable speedups when solving sparse approximation problems. The\nspecific structure that we endow onto sparse models is that of a multi-scale\nmodeling where the sparse representation at each scale is constrained by the\nsparse representation at coarser scales. We show that this cross-scale\npredictive model delivers significant speedups, often in the range of\n10-60$\\times$, with little loss in accuracy for linear inverse problems\nassociated with images, videos, and light fields.

It\nis W[1]-hard to compute the exact optimum, but there is a randomized FPT\napproximation scheme (FPTAS), which computes a $(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation in\ntime $f(k,\\epsilon)\\cdot poly(n)$. 3.

Previous solutions for kernels methods usually assume a\ncomplexification approach, where the real-valued kernel is replaced by a\ncomplex-valued one. This approach is limited. Based on results in\ncomplex-valued linear theory and Gaussian random processes we show that a\npseudo-kernel must be included. This is the starting point to develop the new\ncomplex-valued formulation for Gaussian process for regression (CGPR). We face\nthe design of the covariance and pseudo-covariance based on a convolution\napproach and for several scenarios. Just in the particular case where the\noutputs are proper, the pseudo-kernel cancels. Also, the hyperparameters of the\ncovariance {can be learnt} maximizing the marginal likelihood using Wirtinger's\ncalculus and patterned complex-valued matrix derivatives. In the experiments\nincluded, we show how CGPR successfully solve systems where real and imaginary\nparts are correlated. Besides, we successfully solve the nonlinear channel\nequalization problem by developing a recursive solution with basis removal. We\nreport remarkable improvements compared to previous solutions: a 2-4 dB\nreduction of the MSE with {just a quarter} of the training samples used by\nprevious approaches.

Fake reviews are often detected based on several signs,\nincluding 1) they occur in short bursts of time; 2) fraudulent user accounts\nhave skewed rating distributions. However, these may both be true in any given\ndataset. Hence, in this paper, we propose an approach for detecting fraudulent\nreviews which combines these 2 approaches in a principled manner, allowing\nsuccessful detection even when one of these signs is not present. To combine\nthese 2 approaches, we formulate our Bayesian Inference for Rating Data (BIRD)\nmodel, a flexible Bayesian model of user rating behavior. Based on our model we\nformulate a likelihood-based suspiciousness metric, Normalized Expected\nSurprise Total (NEST). We propose a linear-time algorithm for performing\nBayesian inference using our model and computing the metric. Experiments on\nreal data show that BIRDNEST successfully spots review fraud in large,\nreal-world graphs: the 50 most suspicious users of the Flipkart platform\nflagged by our algorithm were investigated and all identified as fraudulent by\ndomain experts at Flipkart.

Our ADMM updates each of the primal variables\n$x_0,\\ldots,x_p,y$, followed by updating the dual variable. We separate the\nvariable $y$ from $x_i$'s as it has a special role in our analysis.\n  The developed convergence guarantee covers a variety of nonconvex functions\nsuch as piecewise linear functions, $\\ell_q$ quasi-norm, Schatten-$q$\nquasi-norm ($0<q<1$), minimax concave penalty (MCP), and smoothly clipped\nabsolute deviation (SCAD) penalty. It also allows nonconvex constraints such as\ncompact manifolds (e.g., spherical, Stiefel, and Grassman manifolds) and linear\ncomplementarity constraints. Also, the $x_0$-block can be almost any lower\nsemi-continuous function.\n  By applying our analysis, we show, for the first time, that several ADMM\nalgorithms applied to solve nonconvex models in statistical learning,\noptimization on manifold, and matrix decomposition are guaranteed to converge.\n  Our results provide sufficient conditions for ADMM to converge on (convex or\nnonconvex) monotropic programs with three or more blocks, as they are special\ncases of our model.\n  ADMM has been regarded as a variant to the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM).\nWe present a simple example to illustrate how ADMM converges but ALM diverges\nwith bounded penalty parameter $\\beta$. Indicated by this example and other\nanalysis in this paper, ADMM might be a better choice than ALM for some\nnonconvex \\emph{nonsmooth} problems, because ADMM is not only easier to\nimplement, it is also more likely to converge for the concerned scenarios.

In this paper, we frame and present results\non the problem of approximate computation of Gr\\\"obner bases. We show that it\nis NP-hard to construct a Gr\\\"obner basis of the ideal generated by a set of\npolynomials, even when the algorithm is allowed to discard a $(1 - \\epsilon)$\nfraction of the generators, and likewise when the algorithm is allowed to\ndiscard variables (and the generators containing them). Our results shows that\ncomputation of Gr\\\"obner bases is robustly hard even for simple polynomial\nsystems (e.g. maximum degree 2, with at most 3 variables per generator). We\nconclude by greatly strengthening results for the Strong $c$-Partial Gr\\\"obner\nproblem posed by De Loera et al.

Such models provide useful high-level\nrepresentations of motions allowing clustering, searching and faster labeling\nof new sequences. We also propose a new, realistic partitioning of a\nwell-known, high quality motion-capture dataset for better evaluations. We\nfurther explore a novel formulation for future-predicting decoders based on\nconditional recurrent generative adversarial networks, for which we propose\nboth soft and hard constraints for transition generation derived from desired\nphysical properties of synthesized future movements and desired animation\ngoals. We find that using such constraints allow to stabilize the training of\nrecurrent adversarial architectures for animation generation.

This makes\nequalization of channels with long impulse responses using either zero-forcing\nor minimum mean square error (MMSE) filters computationally expensive. Sparse\nequalization is a widely-used technique to solve this problem. In this paper, a\ngeneral framework is provided that transforms the problem of sparse linear\nequalizers (LEs) design into the problem of sparsest-approximation of a vector\nin different dictionaries. In addition, some possible choices of sparsifying\ndictionaries in this framework are discussed. Furthermore, the worst-case\ncoherence of some of these dictionaries, which determines their sparsifying\nstrength, are analytically and/or numerically evaluated. Finally, the\nusefulness of the proposed framework for the design of sparse FIR LEs is\nvalidated through numerical experiments. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures, IEEE GlobalSIP'15 Conference", "1511.07174": "Developing a High Performance Software Library with MPI and CUDA for\n  Matrix Computations,Nowadays, the paradigm of parallel computing is changing. CUDA is now a\npopular programming model for general purpose computations on GPUs and a great\nnumber of applications were ported to CUDA obtaining speedups of orders of\nmagnitude comparing to optimized CPU implementations. Hybrid approaches that\ncombine the message passing model with the shared memory model for parallel\ncomputing are a solution for very large applications. We considered a\nheterogeneous cluster that combines the CPU and GPU computations using MPI and\nCUDA for developing a high performance linear algebra library. Our library\ndeals with large linear systems solvers because they are a common problem in\nthe fields of science and engineering. Direct methods for computing the\nsolution of such systems can be very expensive due to high memory requirements\nand computational cost. An efficient alternative are iterative methods which\ncomputes only an approximation of the solution. In this paper we present an\nimplementation of a library that uses a hybrid model of computation using MPI\nand CUDA implementing both direct and iterative linear systems solvers. Our\nlibrary implements LU and Cholesky factorization based solvers and some of the\nnon-stationary iterative methods using the MPI/CUDA combination. We compared\nthe performance of our MPI/CUDA implementation with classic programs written to\nbe run on a single CPU. Comment: in Computational Methods for Social Sciences, VOL. I, ISSUE 2/2013", "1511.07212": "Face Alignment Across Large Poses: A 3D Solution,Face alignment, which fits a face model to an image and extracts the semantic\nmeanings of facial pixels, has been an important topic in CV community.\nHowever, most algorithms are designed for faces in small to medium poses (below\n45 degree), lacking the ability to align faces in large poses up to 90 degree.\nThe challenges are three-fold: Firstly, the commonly used landmark-based face\nmodel assumes that all the landmarks are visible and is therefore not suitable\nfor profile views. Secondly, the face appearance varies more dramatically\nacross large poses, ranging from frontal view to profile view. Thirdly,\nlabelling landmarks in large poses is extremely challenging since the invisible\nlandmarks have to be guessed. In this paper, we propose a solution to the three\nproblems in an new alignment framework, called 3D Dense Face Alignment (3DDFA),\nin which a dense 3D face model is fitted to the image via convolutional neutral\nnetwork (CNN). We also propose a method to synthesize large-scale training\nsamples in profile views to solve the third problem of data labelling.\nExperiments on the challenging AFLW database show that our approach achieves\nsignificant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

We also\ninvestigate the relationship between the set of players that can win an SE\ntournament under some seeding (so called SE winners) and other traditional\ntournament solutions. In addition, we generalize and strengthen prior work on\nprobabilistic models for generating tournaments. For instance, we show that\n\\emph{every} player in an $n$ player tournament generated by the Condorcet\nRandom Model will be an SE winner even when the noise is as small as possible,\n$p=\\Theta(\\ln n/n)$; prior work only had such results for $p\\geq\n\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\ln n/n})$. We also establish new results for significantly more\ngeneral generative models.

Multiple OLS (mOLS) is a recently proposed improved\nversion of OLS which selects multiple candidates per iteration by generalizing\nthe greedy selection principle used in OLS and enjoys faster convergence than\nOLS. In this paper, we present a refined version of the mOLS algorithm where at\neach step of the iteration, we first preselect a submatrix of the measurement\nmatrix suitably and then apply the mOLS computations to the chosen submatrix.\nSince mOLS now works only on a submatrix and not on the overall matrix,\ncomputations reduce drastically. Convergence of the algorithm, however,\nrequires ensuring passage of true candidates through the two stages of\npreselection and mOLS based selection successively. This paper presents\nconvergence conditions for both noisy and noise free signal models. The\nproposed algorithm enjoys faster convergence properties similar to mOLS, at a\nmuch reduced computational complexity.

Assuming unknown\narbitrary dynamics of renewable source, loads, and electricity price, we aim at\noptimizing the load scheduling and energy storage control simultaneously in\norder to minimize the overall system cost within a finite time period. Besides\nincorporating battery operational constraints and costs, we model each\nindividual load task by its requested power intensity and service durations, as\nwell as the maximum and average delay requirements. To tackle this finite time\nhorizon stochastic problem, we propose a real-time scheduling and storage\ncontrol solution by applying a sequence of modification and transformation to\nemploy Lyapunov optimization that otherwise is not directly applicable. With\nour proposed algorithm, we show that the joint load scheduling and energy\nstorage control can in fact be separated and sequentially determined.\nFurthermore, both scheduling and energy control decisions have closed-form\nsolutions for simple implementation. Through analysis, we show that our\nproposed real-time algorithm has a bounded performance guarantee from the\noptimal T-slot look-ahead solution and is asymptotically equivalent to it as\nthe battery capacity and time period goes to infinity. The effectiveness of\njoint load scheduling and energy storage control by our proposed algorithm is\ndemonstrated through simulation as compared with alternative algorithms. Comment: to appear in IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid", "1511.08861": "Loss Functions for Neural Networks for Image Processing,Neural networks are becoming central in several areas of computer vision and\nimage processing and different architectures have been proposed to solve\nspecific problems. The impact of the loss layer of neural networks, however,\nhas not received much attention in the context of image processing: the default\nand virtually only choice is L2. In this paper, we bring attention to\nalternative choices for image restoration. In particular, we show the\nimportance of perceptually-motivated losses when the resulting image is to be\nevaluated by a human observer. We compare the performance of several losses,\nand propose a novel, differentiable error function. We show that the quality of\nthe results improves significantly with better loss functions, even when the\nnetwork architecture is left unchanged.

For this model, we establish a general DoF\nachievability framework based on linear precoding and post-processing methods.\nThe framework poses a nonlinear problem with respect to user precoders and\npost-processors, as well as relay precoders. To solve this problem, we adopt an\nuplink-downlink asymmetric strategy, where the user precoders are designed for\nsignal alignment and the user post-processors are used for interference\nneutralization. With the user precoder and post-processor designs fixed as\nsuch, the original problem then reduces to a problem of relay precoder design.\nTo address the solvability of the system, we propose a general method for\nsolving matrix equations. This method is also useful to the DoF analysis of\nmany other multiway relay networks. Together with the techniques of antenna\ndisablement and symbol extension, an achievable DoF of the symmetric\nmulti-relay MIMO Y channel is derived for an arbitrary setup of (K, M, N). We\nshow that, for K >= 2, the optimal DoF is achieved for M/N in [0,\nmax{sqrt(3K)/3,1}) and [(3K+sqrt(9K^2-12K))/6,infinity). We also show that the\nuplink-downlink asymmetric design proposed in this paper considerably\noutperforms the conventional approach based on uplink-downlink symmetry.
